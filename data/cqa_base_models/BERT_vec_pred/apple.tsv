Whereas , previously , with iOS 5 , one had to use Apple ID email addresses only in order for it to sync across devices . First , you need to make sure all your devices are on the same Apple ID .

8	10717	What happens in your proposed case is that if you delete messages from the iPhone , and then power on your Mac , the Mac will not receive those deleted messages . EDIT : Well , folks , I stand corrected . I certainly believed the above to be the case , but my tests proved otherwise . I sent several messages from multiple devices to other devices that were powered down . Each message was deleted before the recipients were powered back on . Although there was a significant lag in reception ( one took nearly ten minutes ) , all messages that were sent were received , even those that were deleted . Several of the messages were out of sync , which does n't surprise me given the flakiness of the iMessage system during its infancy . However , to the original question , the answer is that messages , deleted or otherwise , eventually find their destination , even to devices that were powered down when those messages were transmitted .

On its own , in can seem a little lackluster or underwhelming , but when combined with other applications or used as the ' glue ' between them it really shines . One of my uses is to automatically organize PDFs of schedules from work . I 've got a Dropbox account , and make use of <URL> to allow me to email attachments straight into my Dropbox . The issue is that they 're not always consistently named , and I do n't feel like manually renaming them . I have Hazel watch the destination folder , and when a PDF arrives , whether its named 7.30 , 7/30 , 07-30 , etc , it automatically renames it , moves it to folder with other already acted on files , and archives away old versions . The result is that I have a nice archive of schedules , all consistently named/sorted . I use Hazel to help out with video encoding/tagging tasks . After encoding a file , Hazel picks up on it in the destination directory , and automatically renames it based on a consistent naming scheme . Once it does this , it applies a label to the file , and moves it to a new folder where files awaiting metadata live . Any file here gets passed through an automator script that adds some basic metadata ( show type , year , etc ) before passing it into <URL> for the final touches before throwing it into iTunes . It also handles more mundane tasks . Some trackers list . torrent files with a . txt extension . Hazel will monitor the downloads folder , and if a file with a . txt extension shows up , it checks the file 's "" Where from "" attribute , and if it matches a trackers website , it changes the extension to . torrent and moves the file into my Torrents directory so that Transmission can add it . There are times when I do n't need to see my Bootcamp volumes mounted on the desktop . Hazel can check for this volume , and it if sees it mounted , it 'll run a shell script to unmount it ."	0.14089436829090118	-0.01771540939807892	0.0

46	10717	"To strictly answer your question , it is not possible to delete something from your device and have it remain and accessible from iCloud Photo Library . Here 's more details : The idea behind iCloud Photos Library is to have all your photos on all your devices . Picture a parent of a small family in California who takes , on average , several photos a week and has a Mac , iPad , and iPhone . When they take a photo on their iPhone , it syncs to their other two devices automatically so that when they arrive home , they can open their computer and view the photos or videos they took . Pretty cool ? Yes , for some situations it 's ideal . But there 's a problem , if you do n't have enough storage on your phone to hold all of the photos , iCloud Library is stuck until you open settings and allow it to optimize your device storage . It then saves low resolution photos to your device and will download the high resolution version when you view the photo . This too is convenient in some situations . The problem comes in when you want to control what photos go where . I 've taken thousands of photos and videos on my iPhone and I do n't want all of those on my phone even if I could have that . But with iCloud Library enabled , all of your photos will be on your device as there is no way to control what images are in the cloud versus on your device . So , it seems that Apple 's solution to your problem of having too many photos and videos on your phone would be to enable the option to optimize device storage . However , here is , by far , the biggest problem with iCloud Photo Library and the "" optimize device storage "" option .

47	10717	They both output a similar voltage level ~ 5V . However this is going to change once you start drawing current from the charger . The output will decrease if you start pulling more current . iPad charger provides 2.1 A at 5.2 V means you can pull 2.1 A and the output will stay at 5.2 V. Output voltage might go down if you draw more current ( say by attaching 2 ohm resistor across the leads and trying to draw 2.6 A ) and thereby also reduce the expected output current . Similarly , iPhone charger will be able to provide rated voltage ( 5V ) only up to 1A of current draw . After that , you might see a voltage drop . In terms of hardware , iPad charger will have a higher power circuit - most likely a bigger flyback transformer , mosfets with higher current capacity and bigger filter capacitors . You can benefit from ipad charger while charging an iphone if your iphone is able to draw current higher than 1A . If this is not the case , then there is no point . However you will notice longer charge times when you charge your ipad using iphone charger . Also , it 's false assumption that load remains the same . Here is a sample charging current and voltage curve for a li-po battery which I picked from a google image search : <URL> As you can see , initially the battery voltage is lower since it has discharged .

The connections in the bottom of the dock frequently came loose , meaning the end user would lose USB connectivity , network connectivity , etc even though from their perspective the Mac appeared to be docked correctly . The Kwikdock did n't have the build quality we desired . The Belkin Thunderbolt dock and Matrox DS1 dock are both very similar in that they 're a hub that you connect all of your connections to , then connect to your Mac via a thunderbolt cable .

Our end users are also much more accustomed to the traditional docks offered by Dell and other PC manufacturers , were you click it into place and go . This is the same reason we did n't pre-order a Zendock . We ended up going with the LandingZone . It offers the traditional docking style that our users are accustomed to , the build quality seems to be very good , it 's much cheaper than the alternatives and can be further reduced in cost by ordering in bulk .

If you need your ebook reader to support epub , bookmarks , notes , and dropbox , simply type , "" epub bookmarks notes dropbox "" in the search field of the app store . I like to sort first by rating and check out the highest rated apps , then by popularity and check out the most downloaded apps . Note that sorting by rating and popularity are only available on the iPad . I read the reviews , both at the high rate end and low rate end to get an idea of the types of features people are excited about , and the types of problems people are experiencing . I look at the most recent update notes , and see how long ago it was last updated to get an idea of whether the developer is taking an active role in maintaining the app and is responsive to complaints , or if it 's an old app that works , but probably does n't have new features . At that point the only thing to do is to try out the ones that look most promising . Many apps offer a trial or ad supported version , so the trial can be free in many cases . For others , you 'll have to pay a little to try them out , and if they do n't fit your needs you 've lost a little money and time , but remember that you 're picking an app that should fit your needs for a long time - when you find it it will be worth the effort and money you 've spent on other apps looking for the perfect one . Use internet reviews/forums Do a google search for "" best ebook reader ipad "" or similar , and you 'll often get dozens of "" top ten "" style lists from people who have spent some time not just reviewing a few apps , but comparing and contrasting them . You have to do a bit of wading , and you are going to have a hard time finding less popular subjects , "" best lawn care app "" is n't going to give you such collections because few people will have taken the time to check them out , even though many exist onthe app store .

To keep that in good condition make sure you keep your battery charged ( there are other topics about this how to do this and what is the best ) . In the end , the machine is built to be used and you should just enjoy using it without thinking to much about what is best . Apple already has that done for you :) .	0.1408933401107788	-0.11626076698303223	0.0

88	10717	There are commercial programs that specialize in sync ' ing folders between systems . The one I use is Synk Pro , found at <URL> . Synk Pro allows either folder sync or Master - > Slave copying , so that one folder is designated as the primary repository . Synk Pro can also remain running while the computer is on , keeping designated folders in sync . But there potential problems synchronizing home accounts across different machines . The first one that comes to mind is ~ / Library/Preferences , which stores the default setup information for your system : some of the settings may not work properly on different machines . The Mail folders in ~ / Library could easily lead to data loss : if you update Mail on both systems inadvertently , then synchronizing the folders could result in overwriting messages in one folder with different contents . This can be avoided if you only retrieve mail on one system , and copy that Mail setup to the other machine . If you only synchronize user folders , like Documents and Downloads , most of such pitfalls are avoided . There are also companies that provide data file sync through the internet , by copying your files to their servers , and then copying from their servers to the other systems you select , and authorize by password . Two examples of these are Dropbox and www.sugarsync.com . These services can not guarantee synchronization if you have the same file open on two machines , however . There are some programs designed to work with Dropbox , that allow changes made on one computer to automatically show up on another machine ; for example , 1password or TextExpander . But many programs are not so designed : Apple programs like Pages and Numbers will not work this way . You must close the file on all machines before the file can be sync ' ed . And it should have been opened on only one machine at a time . And these services require $ $ per year for large amounts of content . Dropbox provides free accounts for up to 2 GB of data , so you could try their service for free to see if it meets your needs . It has been very reliable for me . SugarSync is designed to sync files through the internet and provide offline backup . It has been working well after some initial problems , when their Mac program was still in beta . Both these services allow you to sync files to Windows based machines also . And both allow retrieving previous file versions from their servers . Note that if a machine has been shutdown , it may take a long time to complete the updates over your internet connection . My desktop remains running even if I am away from my desk .	0.14090268313884735	-0.05283069610595703	0.0

90	10717	The default behavior is for iCloud Photo Library not to store full-size versions of your photos on your iPhone and iPad : The theory is that only thumbnails are stored on your iPhone/iPad until you decide to view/edit/share the photo , at which point a device-optimized or full-size version of your photo is downloaded from iCloud . ( Note : I know a full-size copy is downloaded when you edit/share , but it appears that if your iPhone has plenty of space it will download a full-size copy for viewing as well , as opposed to just a device-optimized version . This is likely to avoid having to do a second download later if you decide to share the photo . ) When you start running low on space , iOS will begin pruning less-accessed photos and return to simply thumbnails or device-optimized versions of those . All of this happens automatically in the background and you should n't have to worry about managing space yourself .	0.14089353382587433	0.14607426524162292	0.0

92	10717	If I am right you are asking about the red squiggly lines that appear under mis spelt words ? The spell check is a native feature within iOS , rather than the app . So if you type in the app you will get the auto correct . You can use Pages to spell check as this has the red lines but you ca n't put back into drop box . QuickOffice does sync with Dropbox , but does n't spell check , <URL> Documents to Go only offers dropbox sync with it 's premium version which was misled by it 's <URL> . But sadly right now there is no way to spell check office docs , I guess you can edit them and then open on a computer to use the function on the desktop . <URL> so you may want to wait for this ( if it can do one better than pages and sync )	0.14092108607292175	0.08650057017803192	0.0
93	10717	The first part of the sync error message means exactly what it says - your iPhone can only be associated with a single iTunes library . The second half is tricky for people that are analytical , but for most users it 's meant to make them want to back up their phone before they erase it . Regardless of how you choose to copy your content ( sync manually or automatic ) it maintains a connection to a single library to which is is allowed to copy music/films/apps etc to and from , and where backups/restores etc can be made . Unless you know exactly what was synced - you could be inadvertently erasing some content hence the scary general error message . If you introduce your iPhone to a new iTunes library , then it can remove any content that is associated with the previous one . Assuming you still have access to the old one you can copy the files from one computer to another to enable you to sync them back again after , or you can transfer the purchases to the new iTunes library assuming it has been authorised using the same Apple ID . This is an attempt to limit unauthorised copying of music and other content etc , otherwise you could happily take your phone or iPod around to all your friends laptops and merrily copy all their stuff onto your device , where you could then happily sync it back to your iTunes library at home . Other phone content , like emails , contacts , settings should remain unaffected , as these are not held within the iTunes library ( even if you have set iTunes to be the sync mechanism for putting them on your phone , they belong outside of the library . Rule of thumb : if the original iTunes copied the content on in the first place , it will be removed . It wo n't just wipe the whole phone , just what came from iTunes .	0.1409103274345398	0.015282795764505863	0.0

97	10717	"Remember the <URL> ? Apple did license the technology at that point in time to build an iTunes compatible phone with Motorola , before the iPhone era . The <URL> was one of the other few non-Apple devices compatible with iTunes . There was also the case of the <URL> which supported iTunes syncing ( unlicensed ) , but Apple kept breaking the syncing ( purposedly ? ) with new iTunes versions , forcing users of Palm Pre 's to search for hacks to get it working again . I think this shows that it is technically possible ( even through reverse engineering ) , but Apple is not going to sit by and allow it . This probably is even more true nowadays , as they are fiercely protecting the iTunes/iOS eco-system . You could also use iSync to sync contacts and calendars with many different phone models , but it has gone missing since Mac OS X Lion . Here 's <URL> to install it again though . EDIT : Found a quote from Apple regarding "" non-supported "" devices , which illustrates their stance : Apple is aware that some third-parties claim that their digital media players are able to sync with Apple software . However , Apple does not provide support for , or test for compatibility with , non-Apple digital media players and , because software changes over time , newer versions of Apple 's iTunes software may no longer provide syncing functionality with non-Apple digital media players . And here 's a reaction from Apple to Business Week regarding the Palm Pre : iTunes 8.2.1 is a free software update that provides a number of important bug fixes . It also disables devices falsely pretending to be iPods , including the Palm Pre . As we 've said before , newer versions of Apple 's iTunes software may no longer provide syncing functionality with unsupported digital media players ."	0.1409098207950592	0.07823146879673004	0.0
