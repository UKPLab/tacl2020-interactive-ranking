1	22462	Here 's what I do - it simulates the high direct heat and then lower , indirect to finish ( like on the real grill with multiple zones ) : Put the ' grill ' on the top rack ( make sure its not coated or non-stick , that it can take high heat ) . ( I do mean to put a pan under this to catch grease . ) Turn the oven to broil for a few minutes . Prep your chicken . Put it in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes ( I ca n't really give you a time here because it depends on thickness and other things ) , but you 're trying to promote that browning and a bit of char like the grill . * After its been in a few minutes and browned/charred somewhat , pull it out and quickly flip it and repeat . If your dish is n't fully cooked to your liking , move the item to the middle rack and turn the heat down some . Pull it out when finished and Rest the meat . Enjoy To be honest though , for indoor grilling - I usually preheat the oven to 400 , get some grill marks on a cast iron grill pan , and then finish in the oven . Its only when the volume is too much that I do the above method . Cast iron grill pan for a couple of servings has always been much less troublesome than the broiler which can bring items from tasty to ruined in record time for me . * Some people close the oven door here , some do n't - its the difference between if you just want to sear it or really start to cook it . I pretty nearly always close the door , but I 'm also the guy who always puts the lid back on the grill .	0.14916735887527466	-0.04244984686374664	0.0
2	22462	There are a couple tricks I 've learned from Cook 's Illustrated about making oven fries : Soak your cut potatoes in warm water to rinse off excess surface starch . Drain them and dry them very well ( I use a salad spinner and paper towels ) . Use a heavy duty sheet pan on the bottom rack of a hot oven to focus the heat on crisping the bottoms of the potatoes . Oil your sheet pan well , and sprinkle salt on it . This will act kind of like ball bearings under the potatoes to prevent them from sticking too hard . For the first 5-10 minutes , tightly wrap the sheet pan ( with the potatoes ) with aluminum foil . This will essentially steam the potatoes and help get a really nice creamy interior . After that , remove the foil and flip the potatoes halfway through . Make sure you use a thin metal spatula when you flip them . These techniques work well for potatoes in general , and really do turn out some fantastic spuds .	0.14921940863132477	0.09493238478899002	0.0
3	22462	General food safety guidelines give you four hours of time between 40F and 140F ; more than that , and unsavory bacteria exceed nominally safe limits . So , there 's your safety limit . Total time counts , that is , in a bag back from the grocer for 2 hours , then in the fridge and back down to 34F and then out for 1 hour on the counter = 1 hour left until it needs to go over 140 for ten minutes ( or 165 for 1 minute ) or into your mouth . And of course , there 's the amount of time it was left on the dock , etc. etc. . That said , if you left fish in the fridge for a week , it would be mushy and bad tasting raw -- so you also must use your tastebuds and nose to see if you want to eat it raw ; food safety is n't the only concern .	0.1493733525276184	0.05051809549331665	0.0
4	22462	Your best bet for this is xanthan gum , which is an excellent stabiliser . Whilst the distinction between ' natural ' and ' unnatural ' is fraught with difficulties , insofar as xanthan gum is a product of microbial fermentation then it is no more ' unnatural ' than alcohol or vinegar . Be careful not to use too much though ( unless , of course , you want your drink to have the texture of mucus ) , you really only want to use about 0.4 % of the volume of the liquid you 're trying to stabilise : so if you have 500ml of milk then you would use 2g of gum . Add it to your liquid and use a blender or an immersion stick to incorporate , a few pulses should do , any more than that and you 'll just incorporate air and you could just end up with an annoyingly stable foam !	0.14925391972064972	-0.010678011924028397	0.0

7	22462	"That advice is n't "" wrong "" and millions of people keep keep fish sauce in a cabinet for decades . Regarding safety , it 's generally OK to store fish sauce at room temperature for years , but that is n't recommended by government worrywarts for best quality . <URL> . Pathogens run in fear faced with this stuff , but it can ( rarely ) develop "" offness "" . It is conservative to even bring up this article from <URL> : The fish-sauce-making process is carefully controlled to prevent the growth of dangerous bacteria . First , whole , tiny fish ( predominantly anchovies ) are combined with salt in roughly a three-to-one ratio . The mixture is then tossed into either concrete or wooden tanks . Enzymes contained within the cells of the fish flesh degrade the proteins , fats , and other molecules into amino acids ( compounds responsible for the deeply savory flavor in fish sauce ) , eventually liquifying the solid tissue . The salt accelerates this process , known as protein hydrolysis , by causing the fish cells to open up , which releases the enzymes . The briny conditions in the tank keep most microbes and all pathogens at bay , but some harmless , extremely salt-tolerant bacteria , known as halophilic bacteria , survive . These occur naturally in the guts , mouth , and skin of the decomposing anchovies . They too break down the fish proteins , yielding various acids , alcohols , and nitrogen compounds that give fish sauce its characteristic cheesy , meaty flavors . But by the end of fish sauce 's six - to twelve-month fermentation period , the salt has managed to kill even the hardiest halophilic bacteria . At this point , the clear , amber liquid in the tanks is filtered , and any sediment is discarded . The fermentation process does such a good job of killing off bacteria that no pasteurization is required . There is no legal requirement in the U.S. for fish sauce to bear an expiration date , but most manufacturers put dates on the label anyway , since people are more inclined to trust foods that tell us when they should be discarded . These dates tend to be three to four years from the date of manufacture , which is actually on the conservative side in light of industry guidelines . The Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods in the ASCA Countries ( published by the Association for Science Cooperation in Asia , a science-policy organization ) ascribes to the condiment a shelf life of five years . This is is n't to say fish sauce will always be good , either before or after the use-by date ( though you should always refrigerate it after opening ) . It can deteriorate in quality over an extended period of time due to chemical reactions , resulting in color changes or the development of "" off "" flavors . On rare occasions mold or yeast might develop on the inside surface or lip of the bottle where there 's excess moisture and less salt . These growths are usually innocuous , but as with any food , if it looks strange , smells strange , or tastes strange , you should throw it out . So , grudgingly , I say throw this batch out 'cause it 's fuzzy . But do n't lose any sleep over it . Next time buy a bottle that you 're likely to use within a couple of years and keep it in the fridge after opening ."	0.14919975399971008	-0.10438842326402664	0.0
8	22462	"There are many cultivars of rhubarb , just like there are for most other vegetables . Surprisingly , it seems some cultivars with the best flavor have less of the prized pink color . The color of any particular rhubarb stalk will depend on both the cultivar , and how it was grown . You should treat it the same way , regardless of the color . So yes , green rhubarb is safe to eat , with the same caveats as apply to any rhubarb . Especially , do n't eat the leaves . In On Food and Cooking ( 2004 edition ) , Harold McGee indicates that rhubarb tends to be about 1.5-2 .0 % acid by weight ( mostly oxalic acid ) , which makes it quite tart . This is an inherent aspect of the vegetable . The only way you really will reduce it is to use proportionately less of it in your recipe , by either reducing the absolute quantity of rhubarb , or increasing the quantity of other ingredients . In pies and coblers , this is usually done by combining the the rhubarb with another fruit like strawberries , as well as a great deal of sugar . Oxalic acid is soluble in water at about 14 grams / 100 mL , and even more soluble in ethanol at about 24 g / 100 mL , <URL> . This means that anything you infuse into vodka is likely to be extremely tart , perhaps unpleasantly so . You will want to carefully control steeping times and or ratios . While I have never tried this , I would imagine the tartness would overwhelm whatever rhubarb flavor you might pick up . There might be a reason there are so few famous rhubarb cocktails . Still , there are a number of rhubarb cocktail recipes that you can find by googling "" <URL> "" . They tend to start with a cooked down puree of rhubarb , rather than an infusion , however , and it seems to often be used in the sour role ."	0.14920003712177277	0.011759087443351746	0.0

11	22462	Yes . The important fat is the one the starch first goes into . The higher temperature reached by fats ( as compared to water or milk ) helps cook the flour , creating flavors . The liquid added later dilutes the mixture into a sauce . The liquid 's fats are not as crucial for the sauce 's thickness as the liquid 's proteins . I think of the cooked butter-flour mixture as a thickner that can be added to milk , broths , and even a saucy dish . The roux thickens way better than just a slurry of flour and a cold liquid .

17	22462	I like the first answer , but feel the need to clarify the ' pepperoni ' reference . Yes , they are slices of bagels . However , if you cut a bagel vertically in half as it rests flat and treat each half as if you were slicing a curved salumi , all of your chips will be inconsistently thick on one edge and thin on the other ( thanks to the properties of a torus ) . While that leaves them all consistently round , their thickness varies , which makes evenly toasting them a problem . The more conventional approach : take the whole bagel as it lies flat on the cutting board , and slice it vertically but thinly from one side to the other . There will be much more variation in chip shape , but it 's much easier to maintain the right thickness for even toasting . This is also why most ( if not all ) bags of chips are sliced in this manner , and you see such wild variation of circles , ovals , etc in chip shape . A Gildy 's Blade or a tightly serrated bread knife will do the job . Along with a bit of patience .	0.14931988716125488	0.04180552065372467	0.0

In a traditional French kitchen you want generic stocks ( fish/brown/chicken / veal ) that are able to be used for a wide range of sauces/dishes so having a salmon stock around does n't meet that criteria .

Any true Frechman would have turned his back on us in disgust for doing what we did but damn it , it tasted great and the customers loved it ! For any other fish sauces we used the traditional white fish bones . FYI ...

Your freezer may or may not be tuned to be that cold , but if not , you should be able to crank it a bit and get your Noilly Prat just frozen . That said , I would not really recommend leaving an ice cube tray full of vermouth hanging out in your freezer . You may notice that old ice tastes funny .

I would recommend leaving them for a day until just frozen ( covered if you like ) , and then moving them to a Ziploc for long term storage . All that said , freezing will not halt oxidation altogether , but it will help , as only the exposed surfaces areas should be able to be oxidized . Since ice cubes by design have a relatively high surface area , you may consider minimizing the exposure to oxygen by other means . If you have a vacuum sealer , using that would be a fairly simple means to limit that exposure , but a similar effect can be done with a simple Ziploc bag , as described <URL> ( note this link is focused on using this technique for cooking , but it is translatable to your scenario ) .

Then begin closing the seal , and lower the bag further into the water as you continue sealing , so that only the unsealed portion is exposed .

43	22462	"I think for Indian recipes you should in general look for an unstrained , set yoghurt . There are other factors that determine the final taste and texture of the yoghurt ( the bacteria , the type of milk , length of fermentation , ... ) but you may not have much choice w.r.t. other factors than these two : Production process : Set yoghurt is yoghurt that 's made the traditional way , it 's fermented in the pot that it 's sold in . Stirred yoghurt on the other hand is fermented before being packaged ; it 's a more industrialized production process which is cheaper , but results in a more sour , thinner yoghurt . Stirred yoghurt has a smooth , pourable consistency ; whereas set yoghurt is firmer . I got a bit confused when I was using stirred yoghurt the first time I tried making <URL> and the recipe told me to whisk the yoghurt till it was smooth . The pretty sour taste of the yoghurt also did n't go well with the spices , and the juice from the cucumbers made the already-thin yoghurt too watery . You could try fixing both problems by straining the yoghurt a bit and adding sugar , but it 's better and easier to just buy set yoghurt . The yoghurt 's packaging might say explicitly what type of yoghurt it is , but if it does n't or you do n't understand the language : avoid yoghurt that comes in "" milk carton "" - like containers , that most definitely means it 's stirred yoghurt . A plastic pot does n't mean it 's set yoghurt though , but it 's a better bet . Thickness : Strained yoghurt ( like "" Greek-style yoghurt "" in Europe and the USA ) is yoghurt from which the whey has been removed . It 's pretty thick and sometimes also referred to as "" yoghurt cheese . "" In India it 's used for example in the dessert <URL> , but if a recipe does n't specify that you should strain the yoghurt , you should assume it 's unstrained or briefly strained . Wikipedia <URL> : "" In south Asia , regular unstrained yoghurt ( dahi ) , made from cow or water buffalo milk , is often sold in disposable clay pots . Kept for a couple of hours in its clay pot , some of the water evaporates through the clay 's pores . But true strained yoghurt ( chakka ) is made by draining dahi in a cloth . "" Should you really only find strained yoghurt , you can probably just thin it back with water or milk . I should maybe add I do n't have first-hand experience with what yoghurt from India tastes like , but I 've observed that the ethnic shops in my area and one Indian take-away where I could peer into the kitchen all sell/use the exact same brand of yoghurt , which is an unstrained , set yoghurt with a mild ( not too sour ) taste ."	0.14909224212169647	0.08696454763412476	0.0

46	22462	"In my experience at expensive tempura restaurants , sesame oil is almost always used at least as part of the blend , but my understanding is that it is not the roasted kind , which has far too low a smoke point . I 've been to a restaurant in Izu , now closed , where it was obvious because we were seated right in front of the fryer and the smell was quite noticeable , and the fancy place I went to in Tokyo was apparently using sesame oil as well , but they had more effective ventilation , so it was mostly obvious from the flavorfulness of the results . I 've seen unroasted sesame oil in middle-eastern markets and I know some companies sell it in the US , so it is obtainable , and I 've seen it at about $ 40/gallon on Amazon . I also know from experience that a blend of the roasted sesame oil and neutral , high-smoke-point oil will have a higher smoke point than just straight roasted sesame oil , and will add flavor , so it 's at least possible that some people do that . At home and at inexpensive restaurants , other vegetable oils are frequently used , and there 's a simple tempura set that you can buy as a gift pack that I 've seen used as a winter gift . This is usually cottonseed oil or a blend . In some regions , an ambiguous blend called "" salad oil "" is commonly used . It is not unheard of to use tea seed oil ( camellia ) , which is increasingly available in the US at Asian markets ( when I ran a specialty import business , I used to sell sell some that a Chinese tea importer was purchasing until he shifted his focus to larger packages suitable for restaurant use ) . The Japanese entry for tenpura on Wikipedia confirms that a custom blend of sesame , cottonseed and other oils is often used at tempura shops . The Tokyo style and Kansai style is a bit different , with many Tokyo shops serving a darker version thanks in part to sesame oil and egg , and Kansai region versions leaning a bit whiter thanks either to using neutral vegetable oils or lack of egg . I 've used canola oil but it tends to leave an unpleasant aroma in the air , especially after the second use . If I were in the US and on a budget , I 'd probably choose peanut oil , but it will taste different than most of what I 've seen in Japan . I doubt that I 've ever encountered peanut oil-fried tempura in Japan , though there 's a chance I just did n't notice . In practice , I 've found that the most important thing to get good results from homemade tempura is to prevent overloading the fryer , because the temperature will drop too quickly . This is true for other kinds of fried goods as well , but is far more important for tempura because the coating should be fairly thin . As an unpracticed amateur , I 've found that using a modest amount of katakuriko or cornstarch in the flour blend helps produce crisper results . It 's fairly difficult to get an assortment of different items to be ready at the same time , so consider making it in "" courses "" if you want flawless results , or make only one or two items at a time . Tempura restaurants tend to have wide , slightly shallow fryers , whereas most fryers meant for western deep-frying tend to have several stations of deep pots , since it 's ok in many cases for things to be submerged , like when making french fries . It 's quite unusual for tempura to be completely submerged . Edited to add : Assuming you 're coating with a batter ( there are some types that are dusted with flour or katakuriko rather than a full batter ) , I get far better results by keeping the batter ( or the flour ) very cold ."	0.1491989940404892	-0.03464222699403763	0.0

As Ocaasi suggests , you can cover the open lid with a kitchen towel as you start to insure there 's no spray . Start the blender slow and then speed it up . This may not work depending on how fast your slowest setting is . But once the vortex gets going , the liquid wo n't splash . It 's only when the blades start that you have that issue .

68	22462	Swai and catfish are biologically related , but Tilapia is a Cyclid and as such quite far removed . I think the biological relation is not all that critical to their similar taste which you dislike though . The taste of fish relies on a few factors such as : Their living environment ( Fresh , brackish , salt water ) The type of soil on the water bottom ( silt , sand ) The diet of the species ( other fish , water based plankton or bottom dwellers ) Catfish is a bottom feeding freshwater species and likely to have a relatively similar taste to other species that share their living environment and diet . As such I 'm willing to bet you also do n't like the taste of Carp very much . Perhaps the solution lies in finding a fish that has a similar texture to Catfish but is a sea dwelling fish eater . That way you might get the appreciation from your eaters while being able to enjoy your own dishes more .	0.1492314487695694	0.026076985523104668	0.0
69	22462	For most oils , you can re-use them several times , if you 're OK with ( or want ) the flavors the oil takes on from the food cooked in it . The thing to watch is the smoke point . That 's when the oil starts sending off whisps of smoke . For coconut oil , that 's 350F . As oil is re-used , that smoke point starts to drop until it 's no longer able to stay hot enough to properly fry food . We 're dealing with an oil that has a relatively low smoke point in the first place at 350F , as opposed to 450F for peanut oil , and proper frying needs to be pretty close to 350F in order to have the moisture in the food hold out the oil from rushing into the food like a sponge . That , unfortunately means that coconut oil is n't a great candidate for re-use .	0.14922118186950684	-0.025394301861524582	0.0

There is lots of white-fleshed fish available in the North Atlantic , and many will do great in ceviche . Take a look at the flesh and see if it seems similar to what you would usually use , and when in doubt ask the fishmonger for advice .

74	22462	True chocolate , made with cocoa butter , especially of the non-milk variety has a very long shelf life when stored in dry , cool conditions . The fact that the shape is a chip rather than a bar or disc or callet is not really relevant , except for the total surface area on which <URL> can occur . Chocolate is very , very dry , which discourages mold , bacteria , or other micro-flora or micro-fauna from growing , not even counting the preserving effect of theobromine and other alkali in the chocolate . It also resists rancidity very well . Stored properly , it can last for many years safely . Many brands of chocolate chips are not true chocolate , because the manufacturer may have used less expensive fats than cocoa butter , which do not have such excellent storage properties . Assuming you have a quality chocolate chip made from real chocolate , the issues you may find include : Sugar bloom , where the sugar comes to the surface due to moisture dissolving it and then leaving it on the surface when it evaporates Fat bloom , where the cocoa butter separates out onto the surface for reasons not thoroughly understood The chocolate can lose its temper from warming and cooling cycles , if it gets too warm ; this will change its texture to softer , more gritty , and less pleasant The cocoa butter could go rancid ( which I have never experienced ) The first three are aesthetic and cosmetic issues , but the chocolate can still be used in recipes or melted down and re-tempered . Having it go rancid would be cause to throw it out -- but chocolate is very hardy , and resists rancidity -- so if it tastes fine , it is still usable . After two years , you are quite likely to have experienced bloom . The chips will look like they have a white coating , and may feel gritty . While this makes it less pleasant to eat out of hand or in applications where it wo n't be melted down , it will still perform well in recipes where it is melted . They are certainly safe to eat ( again , assuming real chocolate , and no rancidity ) , but they may not have the same pleasant texture and crispness that you would expect . This is why manufacturer 's give them a best by date . Note : you can tell whether they are real chocolate by the ingredient list ( at least in the US , and other places with comparable labeling laws ) . Real chocolate will consist of : Cocoa solids , cocoa , cocoa mass , cocoa butter , cocoa nib , or chocolate liqueur ( all words indicating products of the cocoa bean ) Sugar Flavoring ( such as vanilla or salt ) Perhaps lecithin as an emulsifier Signs that the product is not real chocolate include other ingredients , especially other fats in lieu of cocoa butter ( which is comparatively expensive , and marketable to the cosmetics industry ) . Milk chocolate , which also contains milk solids and milk fat will not last as long , but still probably has a shelf life measured in years when stored under proper ( cool , dry ) conditions . White chocolate chips do not have the additional preservative effects of the cocoa solids and their alkali , and also have dairy solids and possibly milk fat , so they have the shortest shelf life of all . It also tends to pick up off flavors if not in a perfectly sealed , air tight container . White chocolate , I would not keep more than year or so . Of course , chips that are made from other ingredients than true chocolate are going to have a shelf life based on their ingredients , but I can not speak to that , and anyway , in my mind , they are not worth storing .

77	22462	You do n't have to use water as the liquid in your bread . Enriched breads use milk and/or eggs . We have recently had questions about breads which use orange juice . On the technical side , you have to adjust recipe a little . Pickle juice does n't have much dissolved solids , so no need to adjust for that . However , it is very salty , so you should reduce or completely leave out the salt . The acidity will help with gluten development and also with breaking down the starches in flour to make them available for chemical reactions which produce more flavour , so this is a good thing to have . However , yeast itself has some strong pH preferences . It grows best in a slightly acidic environment , but if the dough gets too basic or too sour , it will slow down or not grow at all . I think that the diluted vinegar in the pickle water wo n't oversour the dough , but it would be a good idea to make the poolish with pure water and only add pickle water for the dough itself . As for taste , I ca n't say that much without ever having tried it , but my intuition says that you will get a whiff of pickles , but not a full-blown taste . After all , bread made with orange juice does n't taste like biting into an orange . I think you will notice the difference , but you will still have to add pickles to your sandwiches for taste ( and they are needed for the crunch anyway ) . As for horrible , it depends entirely on personal taste . I am not a fan of pickles or soured breads , and would n't eat it . There are people who drink the pickle water from the jar ; I think they will enjoy the pickle-smelling bread too . If you are a pickle fan , I think it is worth a try , if it does n't work , you only throw out under a dollar 's worth of ingredients .	0.14914706349372864	0.11489047110080719	0.0

81	22462	"No , it is n't possible to over soak wood chips , chunks , planks , or any other size that you want to throw on the grill ( within reason , I would n't soak them for weeks because the water would get scummy ) . In fact , the directions given often grossly underestimate optimal soaking time . I assume this is because the manufacturer does n't want to scare people off by saying "" soak for 12-24 hours before use . "" Wood smokes better when it 's wet . If it 's dry , it catches on fire and produces less smoke for a shorter period of time . What you really want is for the wood to be thoroughly wet so that it smolders rather than flames and produces lots of smoke for a long time . As you would expect , the larger the piece of wood , the longer it will smoke and the longer you need to soak it . My general soak times are as follows : Small Chips - These are very small , coin sized . Generally get totally saturated in 2-3 hours . Large Chips - Between Small Chips and Chunks . Soak for 12 - 24 hours . Chunks - These tend to be about 1/2 to a whole fist sized . These want to soak for at least 24 hours . Planks - For plank smoking . Soak for 8 - 12 hours . You can always soak for less time , you just wo n't get quite as much smoke production . Judge the need based on what you 're cooking . If you want a little smoke on a steak that you 're only cooking for 5-8 mins , then you do n't need to worry about it . If you 're trying to smoke salmon , it matters more .

86	22462	I grew up with a Vietnamese mother that used to put fish sauce in nearly everything . While I ca n't exactly recommend all of her uses ( she once used it in a texas beef chili -- was not good ) , there are a few techniques that are good to know . A common method to create a savory sauce is to use fish sauce with sugar at a 2:1 ratio . For example , you can make <URL> by sauteeing fried tofu with diced tomatoes and adding 2tbsp of fish sauce to 1tbsp of sugar . This ratio can also be used in stir-fries . I would make sure to turn on your air vents when doing this -- the smell of fish sauce hitting a hot pan is ... different than what most people are used to . It works as a savory salt alternative in a lot of dishes . I use it to season fried rice instead of using salt or soy sauce . It generally is a good idea to add this during the cooking process , so the liquid can reduce and meld with the food . It can also be used to quick brine ground pork for savory asian dishes . I 'd add somewhere in the vicinity of a tbsp per pound of ground pork . I use this technique when making Thai <URL> . There are probably other marinating/brining applications , but I do n't have much personal experience with that . You can also use fish sauce to create a wide variety of dipping sauces -- in general it is paired with something sweet ( sugar or rice vinegar ) to help balance out the saltiness . It is also commonly watered down ( <URL> ) in vietnamese dipping sauces to keep it from being too overpowering . On a personal note , my favorite use is straight up on crispy fried eggs ( slightly runny yolk ) over white rice . It is n't for everyone , but it 's something I 've been making and enjoying for years .	0.14924556016921997	0.015218961052596569	0.0

91	22462	Firstly , it strikes me as odd that your recipe has no raising agent - no baking powder , no bicarbonate/baking soda , no self-raising flour . Unless you 're whipping a lot of air into the batter , the cakes will barely rise , and you will end up with ' cookies ' . I would add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda ( baking soda ) and see if that helps . As for the temperature of your oven , I would n't go so far as to halve the temperature and double the time . The idea is that you need enough heat for the cakes to rise at a decent rate then form a crust on the outside . 100 degrees will do little but slowly dry the cakes out . Domestic ovens are rarely well calibrated , so your oven may be running hotter than the dial indicates . Invest in an oven thermometer to make sure you are setting the temperature correctly : I have had an oven run 40 degrees hotter than the dial said before now ! If you have n't got the time to get a thermometer , try setting the oven about 20 degrees cooler on the dial , to around 180 degrees .	0.1491728276014328	-0.020032919943332672	0.0

93	22462	I do n't think it is close to either cous-cous or rice . It is less starchy than both . Also , it has a unique mouthfeel when you chew on it , because the tiny grains ( 1 mm or less ) pop under your teeth . I would try getting the real thing in a whole food store or an organic store , or also online . If you ca n't find it , in these stores , but can get other exotic grains , you can try quinoa or millet . If you really ca n't get anything uncommon , I would use durum semolina . Wash it before cooking and cook it with fat to reduce the starch . Also , I would maybe cook it in more water than needed and remove excess water after it has been cooked and cooled , so your semolina grains do n't form a creamy pudding . Maybe tapioca pearls of the extra-small variety can work too , I am not sure because I have n't tried using them and do n't know what their final texture is . You will notice that , when suggesting replacements , I am most worried about texture . The reason is that the flavor of amaranth is very faint and bland . It is best used as a base for other , strong flavors . So you can use anything with the right texture , the flavor in the dish should come from spices and other components .	0.1492229700088501	-0.03957899659872055	0.0

98	22462	Yes , there is ( generally ) a significant taste difference between whole grain mustard and regular yellow mustard . Texture plays a part of it , but it is secondary to the overall difference in flavor . I say generally because there 's a lot of variation in each , and some extremes of one type may approach some extremes of the other type in flavor . Yellow mustard is usually very mild , and vinegar plays a very strong role in the flavor . Whole grain mustard is usually stronger than yellow , and the vinegar flavor is much less pronounced , if not altogether absent . In many situations , one type can usually be substituted for the other , although it is a matter of personal preference , and many people will argue that some uses of mustard are appropriate for one type , but not the other ( for example , I would never use yellow mustard as a condiment for cheese and crackers , but I would use a whole grain mustard for some types of cheese ) .	0.14929765462875366	-0.009525786153972149	0.0
99	22462	"I think the cost effective-ness and worth it portion of the question is quite subjective since there is n't a way to directly compare salt with cookware grade salt block . These salt blocks are considered unusable when it becomes cracked and fall apart , not when all the salt has been used up . Thus the price is for the novelty of using these blocks to cook food rather than the actual salt content . And whether the flavor is worth it is complete up to you to decide . Due the obscurity of Himalayan salt blocks , I will provide a little background information for those who are n't familiar . Due to the Himalayan salt blocks ' unique lattice formation , it has very low moisture and porosity . Due to this property it can be heated up to extremely high temperatures ( up to 900 degree Fahrenheit ) . Also because of the lack of porosity the saltiness that comes off of it when cooking on top of it is minimal and will impart only a moderate amount of sodium . On top of that , it has many trace amount of other minerals including but not limited to sulfur , calcium , potassium , and magnesium . These additional trace minerals are what given the Himalayan pink salt its unique flavor . Now if you want to cook using the block merely to try out its taste , i would recommend you use <URL> instead . It is a bag of Himalayan pink salt that is meant to go into your food as seasoning . How long a salt block last purely depends on how well you take care of it and luck . This <URL> explains proper heating and washing techniques . Because these blocks are naturally carved out of the earth , fault lines ( sometimes not visible from the outside or even with the human eyes ) can exist on it . These fault lines will naturally grow bigger as the block is continuously heated to high temperatures . Because of this unpredictability , there is n't a "" real "" answer . However some can crack after just several uses ( on one testimonial , one woman claimed it broke after two uses . But she was able to get it replaces for free ) while other can last much much longer ( others have report using it for over a year ) . Usually you can get a replacement if the block cracks in a short period of time . Find out about this warranty period from the supplier before buying ."	0.14915569126605988	0.0822327509522438	0.0
