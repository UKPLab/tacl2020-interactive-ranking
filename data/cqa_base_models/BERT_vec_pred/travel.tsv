0	9289	<URL> , according to Wikitravel . There is no road or rail system . The easiest way to get around Greenland is by plane , particularly Air Greenland . In the summer , Arctic Umiaq Line passenger ships provide service to destinations between Narsarsuaq and Uummannaq along the west coast . Of course , if you got a skidoo or dog sled , you could make your own way around ;) Wikipedia actually has more information - <URL> The transportation system in Greenland is very unusual in that Greenland has no railways , no inland waterways , and virtually no roads between towns . It goes into further detail about the few roads that do exist : There are 150 km ( 90 mi ) of roads in the whole country ; 60 km ( 40 mi ) of the roads are paved . Two towns are connected by a 4.5 km road , Ivittuut and Kangilinnguit ; the rest are isolated .	0.172721266746521	0.06782776117324829	0.0

3	9289	"I 've done plenty of road tripping myself , all over North America , and I think I have some idea of what you want ... Back in the bad old days , before Google , a "" map "" was physically printed on paper , and there were entire books you could buy which had maps of various parts of the geography of a country , as well as a section showing the distances between various towns and cities . I hear they still exist . By knowing the distance you intend to travel , you can fairly well estimate how long it will take . Try this experiment : Drive from Montreal to Sherbrooke , at an off-peak time of day . Note the time you start and end , and the distance you travel . You should come up with approximately 90 minutes and 150 kilometers . If you check Google Maps , it will suggest a very similar time and distance . Knowing this , you may consider a rule of thumb that you can travel 100 kilometers in an hour on an autoroute ( or Interstate in the US ) . Let 's call it 60 miles , since the US is still a backward country that has n't quite adopted the metric system . This seems like a very good estimate , in my experience . Now , drive back to Montreal and this time , do n't use the autoroute . Use the smaller provincial highways and back roads . Again , you should come up with 150 kilometers , but this time it will take two and a half hours ! This suggests that you can estimate your overall speed on such roads at 60 km/h ( or 35 miles in the US ) . This also seems like a good estimate to me . Similarly you can figure out how much time it takes to get off the highway , fill your gas tank and get back on the highway ( maybe five minutes ; not long enough to worry about ) . You must be hungry after all that driving , so find yourself a diner ! Note the time you walk in the door , and the time you leave . Depending on how quickly you 're served and how quickly you eat , this may take you anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour . Repeat this at several other restaurants , and get a sense of how long it takes you to eat , how long it takes you overall at different types of restaurants , etc. . Crossing the border ( usually 5 to 60 minutes , depending on traffic ) . Not much more to be said about this . What remains to estimate is how much time you want to spend at various attractions . For this , you 'll first need to figure out what you might want to see and do . For instance , you might wish to drive the <URL> . You can do that in ... by our estimate above , just under an hour . But there are several places along the highway that you might want to stop and look at something . That might take you five minutes , or you might be inspired to stand there and watch a waterfall for hours . Only you know for sure . One thing I will advise you not to do is to plan your trip with strict adherence to a schedule . It sounds like you might be tempted to do this . On a road trip especially , you will often run into something that you want to stop and spend some time looking at , and if you feel rushed , then you might not do so , even if you actually had plenty of time . And even if you do run short on time , Quebec is not that far away ... If I were going to give you a nice rule of thumb , I would say to figure on 12 hours for your evening meal , sleeping , getting up and having breakfast . Then about one hour driving for every hour doing something "" touristy "" ... give or take . You might decide to stay a couple of days in some town , for instance . If you 're still not sure , find a couple of tourist attractions right in your city and visit them . See how long it takes . Most people never do this , which is unfortunate for them ..."	0.17322596907615662	0.006434074603021145	0.0

Travel agencies can act as a proxy to buy on your behalf , but they also have to physically go to the train station to buy your ticket .

10	9289	"I use <URL> to plan my itineraries . The website is a bit more clumsy than Google Maps , but the itineraries and ancillary information are of a better quality . In ViaMichelin you also get maps . An overview maps of the whole trip as well as detailed maps for the different steps . These are the same maps as the Michelin maps you would buy on paper . Compared to Google , it is easier to zoom in and to print a given area . The more difficult part is related to printing . It is hard to fit a whole trip on an A4 page . Even for a smaller trip , such as e.g. Brussels - Frankfurt/Main ( + - 400km ) it is hard to obtain a map that is still useable and readable . Moreover , if you take into consideration the price of colour ink or toner , apparently free maps come at a cost . When it comes to long distance travel , my personal conclusion is that there are no ( free ) online resources , which might be able to compete with traditional maps and atlases . If you do not want to spend too much money on maps and atlases , you can do the following . There are road atlases covering Europe or parts of it . These are updated every year . When the updates are available or about to come out , the "" older "" ones are sold with huge discounts . These atlases are not "" dernier cri "" anymore , but remain very accurate and reliable .

12	9289	Firstly , I have slept in plenty of hostels in the UK , without using a YHA card . Any hostel on HostelWorld or <URL> will let you stay there without any loyalty cards . Your best bet is to follow this approach : Go to Hostelbookers ( often cheaper than Hostelworld ) . Choose country , city , and dates . Look at the ones available . Generally they have dorms ( multiple people in a room ) from 3-30 ( ! ) , depending on the hostel . Evaluate based on amenities , price , reviews and the type - some are party hostels ( generally the atmosphere rating is high then ) , some are more low key and friendly . Check for things like - are families welcome ( you may not want kids around ) , does it have a bar ( often louder and drunker ) , and so on . If it 's a HI Hostel ( Hostelling International ) or a YHA one , you can get discount cards for those groups . Often however , you can negotiate on arrival if it 's not too busy , or ask for a discount for multiple nights - generally for smaller or owner-operated hostels . Book ahead , especially in summer - if you have a limited selection , some towns sell out fast at certain times , when festivals are on , for example . Sometimes you 'll start to see similar hostels - chains - in different cities ( eg The Point hostels in South America ) . This gives you an idea as to the standards and conditions and style of the hostel ( also Base in New Zealand , and Wombats in much of Central Europe - Austria and Germany ) . You sometimes get discounts for staying at the same chain - loyalty if you will . The Point used to give free drinks and a t-shirt . Go figure . Of your country list , one exception is Croatia . There are still hostels , but if you go to the Plitvice National Park , there are entire streets near the entrance with normal homes . They have signs outside with either ' no room ' , or a price - and you can rent a room in a house for a night . It was fantastic , private , and very reasonable .	0.17306505143642426	0.04764532670378685	0.0
13	9289	"Personally I did n't plan much , just went with the flow , but that depends on how much freedom you have . Work out how much time you have . Bear in mind that a Russian tourist visa is 30 days , but you can get a Business visa for tourist purposes ( I had zero problems ) and that 's valid for 60 days , multiple entry . Work out your budget . Hostels are pretty cheap in most cities . However , Moscow and St Petersburg are expensive - European expensive . Starbucks in Moscow ( I use it for my price gauge ) was frightening ! Work out what cities you want to stop off in . You do NOT want to just train from end to end . Remember , Russia is BIG . Russia is LONG . Russian trains are SLOW . There are frequent stops - although they are almost to the minute reliable , in my experience . As an indication , Moscow to Novosibirsk takes 52 hours . Work out what class you want to travel in . Platzkart is fun to do for some segments - you get beds in a 54-bed carriage . It 's social , you meet lots of people . Kupe class is 4-beds in a cabin . More secure and quiet , but if you get crappy roommates , it can suck . Work out if you want top or bottom bunk - the price varies . Also some trains ( Between St Petersburg and Moscow , for example ) can also offer merely seating class - but you always seem to get 2 seats or more to yourself , so can sleep quite comfortably , although it 's a lot less secure , and you quite often get drunken soldiers or louts keeping you awake . Work out what sites are near each city , and therefore how long you want to spend there . As a starting point , Moscow does n't near nearly as much time as St Petersburg . Also be aware that if you stop in Irkutsk , you 'll want to go to Lake Baikal , which to do properly you 'll want three days , minimum . Work out a rough guide for length , activities , price and see if this fits into your visa . Look at flights in and out of start and end points ( I assume you 're not going both ways on the train ) . Look at visas for Mongolia and China - but you can pick these up in Irkutsk , Russia quite easily ( Mongolian visa takes 2 days , or less if you 're prepared to pay ) . Do you want to go into the desert in Mongolia ? It 's a minimum 4-5 day tour from Ulaanbaatar . Assuming you finish in Beijing , allow time to travel there as well . Put a couple of buffer / rest days in here and there . Although you will get a lot of resting time on the trains . Learn the ten most useful phrases . Hello , thank you , train station , bus station "" where is x "" , your country in Russian , and "" what time is x "" is an excellent start . Decide if you 're going to buy all your tickets outside the country . Personally I would n't , it gives you more flexibility and I 've never had a problem getting a train ticket even the day before in Russia - well , aside from in Irkutsk after 7pm . Get invitation , get visa , buy flights . Go to Russia , and enjoy it !"	0.17280225455760956	-0.11805465072393417	0.0

I have known people who just used the custom from their background , being either a small bow or a greeting with the hands put together and a subtle head down . It is the gesture that counts .

21	9289	Down is more dangerous . There are three factors contributing to this . When you need to decide on a slowdown in case of potential accident , you basically need to annihilate momentum , and when you are going up , gravity contributes to the total work needed to slow down . When you are going down , gravity works against your intent to slow down , and brakes alone against gravity cant do the same job as brakes plus gravity in case of going up . Second , brakes can ... well ... break . I know of a driver who actually burned his brakes while going down . It was a Russian military truck in Caucasus mountains with manual transmission and the driver was not that experienced with it . Third , when you brake your vehicle 's stability depends on the force on the brakes . When you brake hard as you go down , you can send the vehicle to a drift . I actually have experienced that in the center of Moscow on an extreme slope near the river . Drift can happen when you go up too because of the drag but in that case the car would likely slow down by itself due to gravity .	0.17278309166431427	-0.07115037739276886	0.0

23	9289	You can enter the Schengen area from anywhere you want . A regular Schengen visa is not tied to a border point , a specific journey or limited to travel directly from the country you reside in . You can also in principle enter the Schengen area through another member state than the one that delivered the visa . Finally , you can also leave the Schengen area to go somewhere else than your country of residence or your country of origin . The only thing that really matters is that you must avoid suggesting that you might in fact want to immigrate and stay somewhere in the Schengen area illegally after the expiration of your visa . No matter what you do ( i.e. even if you never changed plans and are going directly from your country of origin to the Schengen state that issued the visa ) , the border police can always deny entry if they are not satisfied that you really plan to leave the Schengen area and they might therefore enquire about the purpose of the stay , ask where you will be staying , want to see your return ticket ( since the one you presented for your visa application has presumably been canceled ) , etc. but I do n't think coming from another country than the one in which you applied for the visa would be a big issue per se .

24	9289	"In my experience there are two situations where people tend to get on the wrong side of the road : After stopping for whatever reason . If you 're thinking about something else when you get back in your car and start driving , you can very easily do the wrong thing based on your usual driving side . Visualise how you 're going to start out ( enter the street ) before you start driving . When transitioning from a narrow ( perhaps a winding mountain ) road to a wider one . This is particularly important if you are in an area with one lane bridges . Here in New Zealand , the road is often marked with a forward arrow in the correct ( left ) lane when the two lane road resumes . It is also helpful to have somebody else in the car who is paying attention to your driving and can let you know if you 're doing ( or about to do ) something wrong . Another pair of eyes definitely helps . For lane changing , well I 've never driven in India so all I know is what I 've seen in pictures and videos . I understand the concept of "" lanes "" is not widespread . In the US , generally you can change lanes whenever there is a broken white line between the lanes ( assuming both lanes are in the same travel direction ) . Signal your intention to change at least a couple of seconds in advance . Do n't change lanes while going through an intersection . There are likely many online driving tests for any particular US state that you intend to drive in . It might be helpful to run through some practice tests if you are unsure what you need to know .

In Andorra you ca n't do a lot of things , but hey your country-counter will increment by 1 . If you 're into mountains/hiking you can spend some time there . From Andorra I would go to Carcasonne . In Carcasonne you can visit the beautiful castle , the Canal du Midi or a old cathedral . The next stop I would make in Beziers which is also a beautiful city with an old cathedral . From there I would follow the cost line and stop in places like <URL> , Nimes , Montpellier or Marseille . Now it depends a little bit if you want to start in the south or east of Switzerland or in the west or Northern part . If you 're going the southern or eastern part I would follow the cost line a little bit more and visit Nice and Monaco.Then I would visit Turino or Milan and finally entering the beautiful southern part of Switzerland , <URL> . There are a lot of nice cities , like Lugano , Locarno or Bellinzona : But you will also find some interesting small villages in the mountains like for example <URL> . From Ticino you can cross the main part of the alps via the <URL> and then arrive in central Switzerland , for example Lucerne : If you want to start in the northern/western part of Switzerland i Would go from Marseille to <URL> and then from there to <URL> , <URL> , <URL> , <URL> to <URL> .

Arrows painted on roads are used to indicate lane splitting into two rather than an upcoming intersection in the road . There are people in parking lots wearing fluorescent vests who "" look after the cars "" . They may be employed by the owner of the parking lot , but might just be hoping for a tip . You may see people leaving them a tip of some coins e.g. 1-2 rand . Watch for animals such as a baboons on the road . Trucks and slow vehicles may pull off onto the shoulder to allow you to overtake . They will sometimes signal that you should overtake by putting their right blinker on . A general rule : ' yield to traffic approaching from the right ' . City speedlimit : 60km/h Highway/freeway speedlimit : 120km/h Police use individual speed cameras , so your vehicle 's speed is measured once and if your speed is over the limit , you 'll get issued with a fine ( they do n't use the average speed over a certain distance as measured by two cameras placed some kilometres appart ) . The highways in the Gauteng province have ' etolls ' , measured by gantries across the highway , some people pay their toll bills , some people do n't . Drivers often do n't use their indicators when turning . Minibus taxis often stop at any spot along the road , without pulling off . Many larger vehicles ( trucks , buses ) are n't roadworthy ( brake lights and indicators not working , and no emission control on the exhaust fumes ) . Beware of pedestrians crossing the road at any spot they wish ( jaywalking is n't enforced ) . You may also find pedestrians and cyclists on the highway . No cycle lanes in the cities , they mostly ride on the shoulder of the road . Watch out for potholes and unmarked speed bumps . When the traffic lights are malfunctioning or are completely off ( this happens a lot ) , treat them as a 4-way stop , and make eye contact with other drivers to make sure they 're not going to skip the intersection without stopping . Always keep your windows closed and do n't interact with beggars or vendors at traffic lights . Keep your cellphone , wallet , purse out of sight ( do n't leave it on the passenger seat ) .

27	9289	Will You Break Even ? In my opinion you would be lucky to break even at the end of the trip . The wear-and-tear from such a long journey alone could cause the motorbike to devalue so much as to lose any margin of profit when reselling it . Having said this , why not do some maths ? Assumptions For the purpose of this answer I will be assuming the following : You will fly to India You will buy a new motorbike You will drive all the way back from Madras to London ( Why Madras ? Because why not ? ) You will drive on the best possible roads , to minimise wear-and-tear ( ha ! ) You will be able to pass all the custom checks in all the countries you will travel through You will be able to import the bike in the UK ( at a cost , of course ) Data Crunching Let 's put some data down . According to <URL> the cost of a new Royal Enfield in India oscillates between 100,000 - 200,000 ( 1074.7 - 2149.4 ) using google and today 's rates - March 2015 ) depending on the model . Let 's pick an average 150,000 ( 1612.05 & sim ; 1600 ) . Now let 's look at the average selling price for Royal Enfield bikes in the UK , via ebay . A <URL> yields selling prices ranging 1200 - 3000 for used , non-collectors , models ( those 99 ads you see are just the deposit for a new bike , whose real cost is something around 4999 ) . The air distance between Madras and London is 8218.75 km , to get a road distance estimate I would say multiply that by 3 , which gives 24656.25 km rounded up to 25,000 km . ( Funny side note , <URL> . ) It is safe to assume that your Royal Enfield will be quite beat after this 25,000 km journey , and thus you wo n't be able to sell it with just slight wear-and-tear , let alone brand new . An ( overly ) optimistic estimate could be selling it for less than half the price of a new one . I.e. something in the range of 2000 . You will have to at least clean it up and polish it , if you do n't consider changing oil , filter , gasket , transmission , etc. . Consider an average petrol price of 1,20 per litre ( this might be an overstimate ) , and an <URL> , you would be looking at a total estimated fuel cost of 25,000 / 27.5 * 1.2 = 1090.91 ( & sim ; 1100 ) . You 're Losing Money Given the following data one can easily see that , by factoring in our estimates -- buying price , wear , selling price and petrol costs -- you are left with a loss of ( + 2000 - 1600 - 1100 ) = -700 . This calculation is of course missing fundamental items such as food , accommodation , paperwork ( and costs ) at each border crossing , unforeseeable roadside maintenance operations , just to name a few . With this in mind , your loss could in fact be order of magnitudes higher -- something along the lines of a few thousand pounds . Royal Enfield Says No to Personal Imports ! According to the <URL> , vehicles sold in India will not pass the UK MOT , so all our conjectures might in fact be <URL> : The following points outline some of the factors that need to be considered in order to evaluate what is involved when you carry out a private import . The scenario is as per the current terms and conditions prevailing , but you should be aware that legislation is constantly changing in these countries to prevent such imports . Indian motorcycle models are different from EEC/UK/USA models and will not pass a Ministry of Transport ( MOT ) test . Models meant for other countries are not sold in India . The Indian model motorcycles can not be registered in any other country other than India or SAARC nations as they do not meet the statutory norms prevailing there . All UK/EEC specification motorcycles comply with Whole Vehicle Type Approval ( WVTA ) and have VIN plates . From June 2003 , all models of bike , not previously imported into the UK/EEC , must have a WVTA with the consequent VIN plate and Certificate of Conformity from Royal Enfield . All USA specification motorcycles comply with FMVSS rules and regulations and have a VIN plate . Each individual state in the USA also has registration rules that parallel the Federal rules so even if a bike somehow gets past US Customs the owner will most likely be unable to register the motorcycle . A motorcycle that does not comply with the UK or EEC or USA rules may not have valid insurance , thus leaving the owner liable to an insurance company refusing to pay out on any claim , including third party liability . Royal Enfield will not be liable for registration , compliance certificates or any documents whatsoever , which may be required for the private import of our bikes and it will be purely at the risk of the buyer . Of course they might just be saying this because they want you to buy from their ( more expensive ) local dealers . Or maybe they actually know what they are talking about . Or maybe even a bit of both . Up to you to judge .	0.1734272837638855	0.014375059865415096	0.0

29	9289	"Your principal concern will be with the airline . They can impose a variety of requirements , but these can vary from company to company . You can generally find information on the company 's web site , or , presumably , by calling the company 's customer service office . Transavia appears to have no special documentary requirements . For children from age 5 to age 11 , unaccompanied children must pay for and use the unaccompanied minor service ; from age 12 to age 15 , this service is optional . For sixteen and seventeen year olds , therefore , we can infer that the service is unavailable . You are probably also wondering about legal requirements imposed by the countries you 'll be traveling in . There appears to be no definite requirement in international , EU , or Dutch law . For example , from <URL> : Documents for minors In addition to their own valid passport or ID card , all children travelling : alone ; or with adults who are not their legal guardian ; or with only one parent may need an extra ( official ) document signed by their parents , second parent or legal guardian ( s ) authorising them to travel . There are no EU rules on this matter , each EU country decides whether or not it requires such documents . Check , before the child travels , the requirements of the country you are travelling both from and to : Here follows a "" choose country "" link that allows you to check the requirements for various European countries . This is followed by a disclaimer and some additional information : The European Commission is not responsible for the content of external websites Bear in mind that , even where a country does not require minors to carry such an authorisation to leave or enter its territory , other countries they transit through may still ask them to show one . When travelling by air it is highly recommended that you check with the airlines beforehand as many require such authorisations and have their own specific forms for this purpose . As each country 's rules may change without notice you are also encouraged to check with the authorities themselves or with the respective embassies or consulates . It is definitely a good idea to follow the above advice . Using the "" choose country "" link for Denmark , we find Other than their own valid travel document ( passport or ID card ) , no particular extra official document is required authorising minors of any EU country to enter or leave Denmark . For the Netherlands ( omitting some text irrelevant to your case ) : Other than their own valid travel document ( passport or ID card ) , no particular extra official authorisation is required for minors of any EU country to enter or leave the Netherlands . Finally , although it appears not to be required , it would not hurt anything to carry a letter signed by your parents or guardians stating that you are traveling with their permission . You could bring a photocopy of their passports or ID documents to support the authenticity of the letter . You would also want a copy of the document showing their relationship to you . This would normally be your birth certificate , but if they are adoptive parents or court-appointed guardians , it would be the adoption papers or a court order or the like ."	0.17295397818088531	0.0203976072371006	0.0

32	9289	"There are literally hundreds of ski resorts in North America . Flying in to any of the major ones will be no problem at all . Some of them have their own airports , and almost all will run shuttles from the nearest major airport . If you are used to skiing the best of the Alps then you will need to go to one of the really top resorts to get the same experience in North America . North American resorts have generally less vertical and on average less spectacular runs - but not by much . Unless you are a top class skier you wo n't notice the difference . North American skiing also works slightly differently to the Alps - the ski resorts own the entire area of the slopes , and you are expected to ski "" within bounds "" . That 's different from the ' village to village ' skiing that is normal in the Alps . The individual resorts are big , but they are n't linked like the Alps ; after a few day 's stay in one you will find you 've skied every run . North American ski areas are typically less crowded than their counterparts in the Alps , giving you more skiing per hour . Always fly the extra distance to get to the Rockies in the West . If you are used to the Alps , the East will disappoint , and the flights are n't that much longer . Some good places to start : Whistler Blackcomb is the chic , cool , place to ski - especially after the Olympics . You will pay a little extra premium for its cool factor , but the skiing is excellent . It also has good nightlife . Fly to Vancouver . Banff and Lake Louise are both top notch family ski resorts , a little less cool than Whistler , but better value . Banff actually has two resorts , Mt Norquay and Sunshine Village , and Lake Louise is only a short distance away ( with shuttles ) . Banff has some nightlife , but Lake Louise very little . Fly to Calgary . Fernie has a huge snowfall and masses of powder . Fly to Calgary . Panorama has an interesting mix of groomed cruising runs and untended backbowls .

33	9289	"This actually depends on quite a few factors . I wondered this once many years ago , and asked around quite a bit . Did n't have Travel.SE back then ;) The earth is rotating at a rather fast speed - and any point on the earth is therefore actually ' moving ' ( it 's all relative ) . Since the points on the equator have further to travel , they 're moving even faster than at the poles . Now , of course , the air is dragged around WITH the earth , thankfully , otherwise the poor chaps on the equator would have wind speeds in the opposite direction of near the speed of sound ;) However , when you 're in a plane , consider that it can take nearly an hour longer to fly across the Atlantic in a westerly direction ( ' against ' the spin ) than ' with ' the spin . When you 're flying with the spin , and by relation , with the wind , you 're not flying ' into ' a force that 's going the other way , as you are when you fly against the spin . The earth is also dragging you with it - or rather , it 's dragging the atmosphere , and you in it . However , what you 'll tend to find is that it 's actually far more dependent in reality on the existence of jetstreams - where the air up there is moving faster than at ground level , and can boost the plane 's speed if going in the same direction . Of course , in the other direction you do well to avoid the jetstream , as it would slow you down . To put it in words more eloquent than my own , I 'll borrow a quote from <URL> , which first , you must consider yourself to be running ... Stop running . If you were to jump straight up in the air , would the Earth rotate beneath you ? ( Those who do believe that the Earth rotates around them may want to stop reading right now . ) No , because when you left the Earth 's surface , you were traveling at the same speed as the surface , so , in essence , the Earth matched your speed through space while you were in the air ! The same condition holds true for an airplane as it travels from Los Angeles to Bombay . If we were to ignore the winds , no matter which direction you flew from Los Angeles , the speed of the aircraft relative to the Earth would be the same . While the aircraft 's speed through space would change , the effect of the Earth 's rotation remains constant , and in effect is "" cancelled out "" no matter which direction you travel . In other words , the speed of the rotation of the Earth is already imparted to the aircraft , and the Earth matches that speed during the entire flight . ( Of course , in the case of spacecraft , these speeds become very important . ) So , the end result of that long discussion is that the rotation of the Earth has no effect on the travel time of an aircraft . Actually , it is the headwinds and tailwinds that cause the change in travel times . Sometimes it is hard to believe that the winds can have that much effect , so let us consider the problem a bit more in depth . In the example given , the flight from Bombay to California ( east ) is 23 % shorter than the trip from California to Bombay ( west ) . This means that the speed of the trip east must be 23 % faster . The prevailing winds pretty much anywhere that we are talking about blow from west to east , so when we are traveling east , we get a speed gain , and when we travel west , we get a speed penalty . Now , if we are to assume that the winds are identical on both days we fly , then the wind speed only needs to be equal to 11.5 % of the aircraft 's speed ! This would cause a difference between the speed to the west and speed to the east of 23 % ! The cruise speed of the extended range Boeing 777 is about 550 mph ( 885 km/h ) at 35,000 ft ( 10,675 m ) . This means that the winds only need a speed of about 65 mph ( 105 km/h ) ( good kite weather ) . Believe it or not , 65 mph is a very typical wind speed at such a high altitude . Speeds of over 100 mph ( 160 km/h ) are not uncommon . If we wanted to make things more complicated , we could consider a region of high speed flow called the jet stream that flows eastward , and if an aircraft can take advantage of these winds , then the travel time can be reduced further . Also note <URL> , which affect all this . So what is the bottom line ? The direction you travel in relation to the rotation of the Earth does not affect the travel time of an aircraft , and , more importantly , a mere 65 mph wind is more than enough to cause a difference in travel time of five hours when you are traveling long distances !"	0.17283758521080017	-0.01983635127544403	0.0

More like 5 if you stay on the ring road . This assumes you obey the speed limit . I 'd advise you to do so as the roads can be tricky , especially for drivers who are n't used to them . This stretch of the ring road is the only one that still has a few gravel stretches . They keep surfacing more and more of it , so I 'm unsure how much is left . Should n't be more than 40-60 km ( not contiguous ) . The speed limit is 80 km/hr on gravel roads ( 90 on surfaced ones ) . Personally , I 'd choose a more scenic route and go via Fáskrúðsfjörður and take Suðurstrandavegur ( road 96 ) along the coast . Quite stunning views . You just take road 92 at Egilsstaðir and then turn onto road 96 as you enter Fjarðarbyggð .

37	9289	The historic principality of Jammu and Kashmir is split between the Pakistani Azad Kashmir ( ' free Kashmir ' ) and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir . India and Pakistan have fought wars over the control of Kashmir and you can absolutely not cross the line of control which serves as the de facto border . Not only that , but as a foreigner you are are not even allowed to enter Azad Kashmir although with a little luck you can still do so . Pakistani-controlled Kashmir also suffered from a devastating earthquake in 2005 and even if you do manage to enter , be aware that it will not have completely recovered . Travel in Indian-controlled Kashmir is possible , if somewhat restricted due to violence between the Indian military and Kashmiris who do not wish to be part of India . Getting to either Kashmir from Europe is fairly straightforward and there are two obvious routes , the northern and the southern . Note that the ' middle ' Caucasus route is not viable due to war , closed borders and general instability in the north Caucasus . North : if you are in Russia , then you must travel to China via Mongolia or , preferably , Kazakhstan . China 's Xinjiang province borders Pakistan and the two are connected by the Karakorum highway . Parts of the Karakorum run parallel to the border of Azad Kashmir , so it is a convenient route if that is your destination . You can also follow the Karakorum to Islamabad and from there go to Lahore , which is next to the border crossing between Pakistan and India . South : starting in Turkey , travel through Iran to Zahedan and cross the border to Quetta in Pakistan . From there you can make the long journey to Lahore ( for India ) or Islamabad ( for Azad Kashmir ) . Getting into Azad Kashmir is possible if you avoid detection by the authorities at the internal border . There are minibuses which travel from the towns Mansehra and Murree to Muzaffarabad ( the capital of Azad Kashmir ) and if no one sees you at the checkpoint , you are in . Even so , hotels will immediately report the arrival of a foreigner to the police , so you should make good use of your time before they come to kick you out ! Many tourists in India visit Srinagar , the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir , so getting there is easy enough .	0.17312344908714294	0.0657980740070343	0.0

44	9289	OK , I can answer a good part of this . From Europe , you can get into Russia fairly simply with a visa - tourist visa is for 1 month max , however , which is a bit limiting ( maybe not for you , but it was for me ) . From there I went south and into Kazakhstan , across Uzbekistan , into Tajikistan . Afterwards I continued north - Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , back into Russia and across to Mongolia . All of this was done with public transport - trains are great in Russia , are OK in Kazakhstan if you can get on one , iffy in Uzbekistan when they 're running and mostly non-existent in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan ( although China wants to connect the one track in Kyrgyzstan with the Chinese rail system ) . Most of the travel was on trains in Russia , and then shared taxis , minibuses , walking and 4WD taxis in the other ' stans . ' What is safe ' is always subjective - I could argue that nowhere is safe , or that anywhere is safe . However , follow the usual safety tips , and keep EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF DOCUMENTATION for unscrupulous border guards , security guards , dodgy police and militia who will often look for a way to get some cash off you . See <URL> for some more information on that fun aspect of travelling in the area . From Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan there are ways out into China , so you could do that , and then travel south . However , I did all this in the heat of summer . There will be some road closures especially at altitude in Tajikistan over winter . Trains should still get you to China via Kazakhstan if you so wanted ( Urumqi seems to be the place to aim for in China ) .

That 's usually okay with most black cab drivers : it helps them turn down the radio , etc for instance . Black cabs are usually partitioned anyway to separate the driver and the passenger ( s ) so it 's not that uncomfortable . ( If you 're taking a ride from Uber on the other hand I 'm usually more conscious of it since drivers rate passengers as well . I do the same thing by letting the driver know that I 'll be on a call . )	0.17310146987438202	-0.07385396957397461	0.0
46	9289	Ok , the comments have given a suggestion about booking another berth , which is impractical if you are concerned that the baby may actually roll over . Some practical tips to consider You can either book a first class or a 2-tier AC berth ( if you are travelling 3 tier AC already and are considering a second ticket for the kid , it may work out cheaper to do this ) , and ensure that you get a lower berth ( which is tough unless you book early ) , the berth in a 2-tier AC or First AC or First Class compartments are much wider than the one in other classes and can give enough room for the kid If you really want this substantiated you can see ( <URL> ) which has pictures and detailed measurements . If you like to be a bit bold and can convince co-passenger the way I did with a year old daughter you can look to replicate what I did . I used to make a cradle in between the seats , I will have to draw up something to explain ( and kindly forgive my horrible drawing ) , you tie a sufficiently long piece of cloth i.e. a saree or something that 's circa 2 metres long and tie it up to the top berth , since the train only shakes sideways this would actually provide a very comfortable journey to the kid ( if he is used to sleeping in those age old cradles made with a similar style at home it would be even better ) . <URL> The third option is to get two lower berths and actually carry a small flat cradle into the compartment and make the baby sleep in it , like this : <URL> I have only thought about this never did this for my travels .

I am also pretty sure it 's not needed in Italy , Scotland or Austria . Indeed , I do n't think I ever came across any mandatory vaccines for travelers outside of yellow fever in at-risk countries ( i.e. tropical countries ) .

As far as I know , the rationale behind mandatory yellow fever vaccine ( and the international agreements to enforce it ) it to prevent visitors from importing the disease and starting an outbreak in a region where that 's a risk . If a disease is endemic and the local population is immunized , there is no point in making a vaccine mandatory and devising some costly enforcement measures , it 's mostly your problem if you get ill .

73	9289	"There 's a bit of per-country variation , but the rule of thumb across Western Europe is that service charges are already included in the bill ( sometimes as a separate line item , sometimes not ) and it 's not necessary to tip in addition to this . If you must , and you usually would n't unless the service is really good , rounding up a euro or two to the nearest suitable number is sufficient . This is usually done only with cash , since the kind of places that accept credit cards tend to also be the kind of places with hefty service charges already in the bill , but you can usually tip by credit card as well the same way you would in the US : just write in the amount after tip and sign . Wikipedia has a fairly handy <URL> . Edit : Sigh .

76	9289	Traveling with a power-strip is an old trick for avoiding to carry multiple plug adaptors , but going from the US to Europe you need to be a little careful . Electricity in the US is ~ 110 volts , whilst in much of the rest of the world it 's 200-250 volts . Although power boards/power strips are generally passive , and thus the number of volts should not have any impact , many of them do include various types of fuses or additional circuitry ( eg , USB ports ) that could potentially have issues with higher voltages . If you were to plug multiple high-current devices into a power board ( eg , a hair dryer ) it 's also possible that you could draw more watts than the board is designed to support . There are a few products that are specifically designed for travel , and designed to support both 110 and 240 volts , such as the <URL> range ( Note : Amazon does n't say it , but the manufacturer has confirmed that these items are designed for up to 250 volts ) Note that going the other way is far less of a problem - a power board designed for 250 Volts will work fine in the US - I have several where I have taken an Australia power strip , removed the Australian plug and put on a US plug so I do n't even need an adapter to use it !	0.17274025082588196	0.07812215387821198	0.0

79	9289	Promoting comments to an answer ... Looking at the ever useful <URL> , there are three typical routes . One is via Turkey , Syria and Jordan .

If you wanted to get to Jordan avoiding Syria , then you 'd have to go through Iraq , which is n't any better ! I think you 'll have to consign yourself to not overlanding it via Turkey any time soon . Ferry in is your best bet . One other possible option is via Egypt .

80	9289	Limits as to the amount of luggage you can take is usually governed by two principles : You must be able to carry your luggage by yourself . Your luggage must not hinder other passengers or safe exits from the train . Special rules exist for large luggage , such as bicycles . Those can normally only be taken if explicitly allowed . But simple suitcases and backpacks are only limited by the principles I listed above . The rules in theory probably differ per country and even per train company , but in practice the above is true in all countries where I have travelled by train ( Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Germany , Netherlands , Belgium , France , Spain , Switzerland , Italy , Austria ) . The only problematic situation I have encountered is when everybody in a small night-train compartment had a lot of luggage and people were forced to take luggage on their bed ( but normally one can get away with simply storing luggage on the floor once everybody has gone to bed ) .	0.17320941388607025	0.09201457351446152	0.0

85	9289	Consider this ; you 're going to Eastern Europe , as you mention in another comment . In Eastern Europe , like in the rest of the EU ( including the UK ) there are people living in a bit of a recession ( some might say quite a big depression ) . Like many in the UK , their thoughts are for their families , friends , how to pay their bills , and how to have fun . They enjoy their weekends , just like you . And for the most part , they enjoy meeting new people , just like ( presumably , since you 're travelling ) you . For the most part , people everywhere are just that , people . Good people . Most are happy to meet people coming to their country - after all , you 're bringing in tourism money . You 're spending in their stores , staying in their hotels , buying their food . All positive . And what of those who are n't all buzzy and happy about a foreigner ? Mostly , like in the UK , you 'll just find them apathetic . Then finally , you have the minority - the few bad apples . They exist in every country , and if you 're unlucky , you may run into them . You might even upset them . They might even do something bad to you - verbal abuse , robbery , or worse . This could happen in Eastern Europe , it could happen in London , or it could happen anywhere - and if it does , you 're unlucky . But for the most part , unless you 're in a war zone , people are good people , and living their lives just like you , and you 'll have a great time , fantastic experiences and want to do and see more . Of course , there are some things you can do . If you 're doing well financially , do n't rub it in . Do n't insult their culture , food , land or anything like that . Remember they have history , especially ex-Soviet states can be sensitive about their past . Do n't get too intoxicated and make a fool of yourself . Funnily enough - all rules that apply back at home too . Above all - have fun , Eastern Europe is fantastic !	0.17315419018268585	0.09924499690532684	0.0
86	9289	This is what the compartment should more or less look like ( <URL> ) : <URL> As you guessed , there is no changing room or something similar . A pillow and sheet like you see in the picture are provided . There is some variation , but most people will sleep in comfortable street clothes or close to that . Usually at the end of the coach there are toilets and a washstand . The washstand is probably the closest you will get to a changing room . You can use it to clean your face , to shave , brush your teeth and eventually do a quick cat wash . No full shower . That you should get somewhere else . If you decide on the cat wash try to leave the washstand as you found it instead of flooded . There might be shower facilities in major stations ( Gare d'Austerlitz in Paris has some for instance , I 'm not sure about German stations ) . If you expect smelly shoes/feet the best option is probably to air your feet and footwear before boarding the train . If you can carry some light sandals to replace your heavy hiking boots , that would be an option . Putting your smelly shoes in plastic bag and knotting it well closed will also make a huge difference . Another thing to be aware of if you want to be considerate towards the other passengers ( and it sounds you are , thank you ) is to avoid noise for people that are already sleeping when you board the train or are still sleeping when you leave the train . If you leave very early make sure that all your luggage is easily retrievable with at minimum on noise . Postpone putting on your shoes until you are outside the compartment , in the corridor . Places to store luggage are under the lower beds ( rather narrow space ) , above the door ( surprisingly large , perfect for bulky items ) and behind that little stair . Avoid putting anything behind the stair when boarding in the middle of the night because putting something there is always noisy . I often put a small bag simply next to me in the bed , but this depends largely on the size of the bag and your own size .	0.17296092212200165	-0.011662120930850506	0.0
87	9289	The first foreign language in all of Europe is English . In all tourist destinations you will find people speaking it , often enough of them that you might think everybody in the country can communicate in English . In a few months you will not have time to learn other languages , but try to learn the local version , for each of the languages , of ' good morning/day ' ' thank you ' and ' goodbye ' and use them with a smile . The mistake most people make is trying to do too much in too short a time . When I see your list of 5 countries I hope you have 5 weeks at least . Typically traveling between countries costs a day when traveling by train , most of a day when flying and leaving you too tired to do sight seeing in what will be left of the day . A day in Greece will cost you 3 days of your vacation , one to travel each way and one to sight see . Get out a good travel guide , libraries stock them and you will often find them in second hand book stores , and work out what you really want to see and whether it is worth it to miss two full days sight seeing for the time you have there . Each of the countries you mention uses the euro . Often the cheapest way to get euros is to use the ATM wherever you are . How much you pay , and whether you need to pay at all , depends on the contract you have with your bank . Contact your bank and find out whether your bank card is ready for use abroad and tell them that you will be using it in Europe , ( and tell them you arrive the day before you actually do , as some forget the time difference and have you ' arrive ' half a day after you actually do , ) and get them to tell you how much each use will cost . Some banks allow you to do all this online , but if in doubt , just talk with a real person of your bank . Your own bank should be able to get you euros to start you off , $ 200 would be a good amount , otherwise the exchange office at the airport even though it might be a bit more expensive , or the ATM in the arrival airport . Do carry some of your own money , like $ 200 , in case your card fails or you have other problems , cash exchanges are more expensive than getting money out of the ATM but having real money will always work better than money in a bank you can not reach . And if you do have a credit card , bring it . The best will be if it has pin and chip , but any CC will be useful in some cases .	0.17307674884796143	-0.06282582879066467	0.0

89	9289	I actually do n't think that driving lessons would help you . The cheapest trick is just to just do it .

Problems arise when you are alone . At least with me especially on secluded scottish roads , it happened more then once that I ended up on the right side of the road , but still , when with enough caution I was always in time to correct . I also do n't drink at all when I am driving in the UK , although the UK is n't as strict in the amount of alcohol allowed as in other parts of Europe ( 0.08 % vs 0.05 % -0.02 % ) . With respect to the steering wheel or the pedals , those are the same no matter where you drive . In the beginning you might end up switching gear in the door or starting the windscreen wipers when changing lanes , but that is only sort of funny .

90	9289	"Are there any statistics showing the likelihood of mainland Europeans crashing in the UK ? ( my emphasis ) No , not that I can easily find , Rural Scotland The Scottish government publish the following : Tourist activity does significantly boost road accident numbers in the rural tourist areas of Scotland and visitor drivers , including foreign drivers , are involved in a measurably greater number of accidents in the case study areas . Half of the drivers involved in accidents in Scotland were within 5km of their home address and fewer than 2 % were more than 240 km from it . However in the police areas of Grampian , which includes Aberdeenshire and Northern which contains Highland , fewer of the accidents involved drivers who were close to their homes . The involvement of tourists compared with locals in road accidents is probably not excessive in relation to their numbers and the increased mileage they probably drive . The exposure data for foreign drivers is not adequate to establish whether they are at greater risk of an accident than local drivers . The majority of accidents caused by foreign drivers arose from the drivers ' unfamiliarity with driving on the left hand side of the road . The accidents caused by UK visitor drivers may reflect their lack of driving and overtaking experience on rural single carriageway roads , since the crashes in which they were judged to be at fault involved losing control , the negotiation of bends and collision with pedestrians or animals . Local drivers who had caused an accident were most likely to have lost control or to have been driving too fast . <URL> Note the second point there . It may be important to distinguish between "" tourists "" , "" foreign drivers "" and "" UK visitor drivers "" - It is n't immediately obvious if the authors include Welsh , English and Northern Irish tourists in "" foreign drivers "" . The fourth bullet point suggests not . It is also worth noting that driving on rural roads in Scotland is very different from driving through London in the rush hour . The report draws this useful conclusion : The data revealed that foreign drivers appear to have difficulty remembering which side of the carriageway to drive on . This may occur when no other traffic is around or when they come to the end of a single track road and rejoin a two lane single carriageway , or at view points and resting places So , drill yourself to pay extra attention in those situations :-) UK in general There are some other UK statistics that might be used to produce some measure of the additional risk - if other data could also be found . For foreign truck-drivers , the accident rates on motorways are eight times higher . A third of accidents involving foreign lorries happen on motorways -- nearly eight times higher than the national average rate for the UK 's 70 mph highways -- with experts blaming drivers unfamiliar with UK highways , driving on the ' opposite ' side of the road and often blind-sided . <URL> For foreign drivers in general , there were 18,865 accidents in the UK in 2006 giving rise to insurance claims . Insurance claims involving foreign EU drivers in the UK have grown every year from 2001 to 2006 according to data from the Motor Insurers Bureau ( MIB ) . Since 2001 , collisions involving EU drivers have risen by 61.4 % from 11,685 to 18,865 . <URL> Unfortunately these figures are insufficient to work out the increased likelihood of foreign drivers having an accident in the UK - I think I would need to find numbers of drivers ( and/or road-miles traveled ) for each group )"	0.17310982942581177	0.24550560116767883	0.0

93	9289	A lot depends on the actual content . IF the content is illegal where you 're taking it ( and that includes any layovers/stopovers ) you stand to get into some serious legal trouble . For example , last year someone was arrested and convicted in Norway for possession of child pornography . His crime ? He had 3 manga/hentai cartoons in his house , which included sexual content . Under Japanese law these are perfectly legal , in Norway ( and elsewhere in the EU ) they 're considered child porn as the definitions are different . And if you have a stopover in say Dubai you have to be doubly careful as anything they consider pornographic can get you arrested and in prison even if you 're just there to switch planes , would never leave the airport . Just porn is n't a problem in Europe of course , it 's quite legal in most countries as long as you 're an adult . CHILD porn however , and in the EU that includes depictions of nude or sometimes scantilly children in cartoons , especially if the context is sexually charged , will get you in serious trouble with the law . That Norwegian guy was lucky to get away with 18 months in jail ( and no doubt a mark on the Norwegian version of the sex offenders registry for life ) , probably because of the low volume . But his life is destroyed , he will forever be branded a child molester and sexual deviant in his country . Do n't let that happen to you , be extremely careful and prudent in what if anything you purchase ( and that does n't just include potentially pornographic comics , there are many things that are legal in other countries but not in your own , think parts of endangered species of animals or plants , sometimes historical artifacts , religious relics , etc. etc. ) .	0.17290402948856354	0.012693704105913639	0.0

The airport stops are located across from baggage claim The airport stops are in Zone 4 , and University City is in Zone CCP ( Center City Philadelphia ) , and <URL> are charged at all times . Depending on your final destination at Penn , another alternative is to get off one stop early at <URL> and either walk or take the <URL> bus ( $ 2.25 ) . SEPTA is a commuter system , and the <URL> do not have luggage racks or closets ; however , the airport is at the end of the line , so the train should not be overcrowded , and you may be able to find a seat at the bulkhead where there is more space . This is a busy line and patrolled by the SEPTA Transit Police . Crime is more associated with Philly 's subway lines than with the commuter rail , though it is possible as it would be in any transit system in any major U.S. city . ( Do n't read too much into the <URL> that floated around the net a few years ago , as the <URL> , and which anyway excludes the airport stops ) .	0.1729031801223755	-0.0576053224503994	0.0
