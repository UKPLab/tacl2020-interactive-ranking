September 17-18, 1989 Hurricane Hugo devastated Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with winds reaching 150 mph, leaving in its wake 20 killed and about 100,000 homeless.
It slowed down on Sept. 19 only to pick up strength again on Sept. 21, hitting Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight with winds up to 135 mph.
Moving inland it lost strength and at 6 A.M. Sept. 22, 1989 was downgraded to a tropical storm.
Seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and the overall damage to property there was more than $750 million.
As the storm proceeded forecasters at the National Hurricane Center with the help of satellites and supercomputers analyzed available data and made an educated guess about the landfall on the U.S. coast.
Charleston and the Carolina coast were alerted and a massive evacuation took place.
Advance warning, heeded by local officials and the populace, undoubtedly saved hundreds or thousands of lives.
Although hurricane forecasting has come a long way it is still not an exact science.
Other hurricane research indicates that storms much stronger than class four Hugo may be in the offing.
Scientists predict that if sea temperature increases by 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.
