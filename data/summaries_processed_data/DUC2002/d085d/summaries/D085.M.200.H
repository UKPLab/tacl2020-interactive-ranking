Hurricane Hugo, starting as a wave off Africa on Sep 11th, 1989, grew to a Category 4 hurricane.
It did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds.
The storm claimed 17 lives in the state.
Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters.
Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida.
There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress.
Pinpointing Hugo's landfall and intensity were difficult.
State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979.
Reinsurers will pick up much of the costs.
The billions paid out this year will reduce insurers' third-quarter earnings and cause insurance prices to rise.
Unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions could create a greenhouse effect that would warm oceans 3-6 degrees, resulting in hurricanes 50% more destructive than Hugo.
Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream.
