The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) remains open following a week of onslaught.
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India completed its first inspection of the books and accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules.
This is just the latest dispute between the government and the troubled BSE.
The Indian market already had fallen 48 percent since early last year, aggravated by a negative reaction to the Indian budget, which helped foreign and expatriate investors, but did not provide the expected tax relief to local industry.
On Friday afternoon, the BSE, along with other Bombay commercial centers, was hit with car bombs.
These attacks struck at the heart of India's commerce, seemingly aimed at undermining government efforts to expand foreign investment and tourism.
While a militant Sikh group claimed responsibility, Indian officials still suspect Moslem extremists, maybe with Pakistani help, seeking revenge for the December 1992 destruction of a mosque in northern India.
The BSE was able to resume limited trading on Monday and the index rose for two days.
This rise was halted by an explosion Wednesday, which killed 45 and injured a score in a central Calcutta apartment complex.
Fears abound that communal strife will return.
