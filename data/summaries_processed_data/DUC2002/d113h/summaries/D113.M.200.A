In March of 1993 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) experienced a series of shocks, but emerged on the upbeat.
The first blow was reaction to a report from the Indian finance minister on February 27 postponing corporate tax reform.
Disappointed with the postponement, traders sold with a vengeance driving equity prices to a 13-month low with the BSE index down to 2,287 on March 10 compared to 2,893 on February 27.
Then the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused the BSE of violating regulations limiting speculative investments.
On the night of March 12 the BSE was damaged as thirteen bombs exploded in Bombay killing at least 255 people, injuring over 1,200 and threatening resumption of intercommunal riots between Hindus and Moslems.
Despite structural damage, the BSE reopened on March 15.
On March 16 an explosion in a residential district of Calcutta killed at least 45.
A Sikh group claimed responsibility but official Indian comments implied that Pakistan was the main suspect.
With the looming threat of riots and war, the BSE index rose by 2.1 per cent on March 15 and even after the Calcutta bombing settled at 2,409.23 on March 17, a marked improvement over the March 10 reading.
