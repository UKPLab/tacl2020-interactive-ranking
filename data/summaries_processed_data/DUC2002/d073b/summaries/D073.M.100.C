Mt.
Pinatubo erupted on 9 June 1991 for the first time in 600 years.
Further explosions continued for five days, with as many as six in a single day.
Philippine and U.S. experts said that a more massive eruption could occur.
The mountain shot out gases, rock and ash.
Clouds ascending from Pinatubo rose to heights of ten miles, turning day into night and covering wide areas in ash.
Personnel from the large U.S. facility at Clark Air Base were evacuated to the naval base at Subic Bay, most of them soon after the first eruption.
