Pinatubo began erupting about two weeks ago.
Explosions are increasingly severe.
U.S. officials denied the possibility of radioactive contamination if volcanic debris hits the weapons depots at Clark AFB, located 10 miles away.
Clark was evacuated.
Four dead and 24 injured are attributed to the eruptions.
About 84,000 have been evacuated.
