McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets.
After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China.
Most significantly, the opening of the McDonald's in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, gave communism its first taste of a Big Mac.
Moving into new markets meant that McDonald's had to overcome a number of problems.
These problems range from competing with local fast food, such as the Pljeskavica in Yugoslavia, to finding reliable supplies for its restaurants.
In the Soviet Union and Korea, finding supplies means contracting with local farmers for beef and potatoes.
In Russia, this meant building a 50M supply facility, a cost which had not been recouped at the time of opening of the second McDonald's in Moscow.
While the taste of the Big Mac met with approval, its cost could be a factor in its success.
In Moscow and Peking, the high cost of a Big Mac, fries, and a shake could mean that McDonald's will viewed as a treat and not a convenience food.
In the Soviet Union, taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two- days wages.
Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.
