"Golden Arches" continues its worldwide expansion.
In 1988, seven years after its first attempt to bring a restaurant to South Korea, McDonald's successfully joint-ventured with Ahn Hyo Young, a Harvard schooled entrepreneur.
McAhn Enterprises Ltd. had to fight government red tape and develop local suppliers in order to open in Seoul.
That year, Big Mac also braved the communist world.
On March 24, 1988, McDonald's successfully opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
Its local competition was the hamburger- like pljeskavica, i.e., ground pork and onion served on bread and eaten by hand.
Two years later, McDonald's had their most successful opening ever, worldwide.
In Pushkin Square, Moscow, thousands of people waited in line for hours at the largest McDonald's in the world for hamburgers, fries and shakes.
This opening day "Mac attack" resulted in 30,000 meals being served over fourteen hours at 27 cash registers.
Customers were surprised and pleased to find efficient, friendly workers in this country of generally surly service.
And then, China, where cooking is a culinary art.
A restaurant opened in Shenzhen, a special economic zone outside of Hong Kong where the average worker's pay there is considerably higher than in the rest of China.
McDonald's hopes to soon expand into Mainland China.
