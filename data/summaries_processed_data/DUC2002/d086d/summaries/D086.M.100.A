In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border.
The two countries agreed to talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives walked out.
The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait.
Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of them to Iraq.
As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.
