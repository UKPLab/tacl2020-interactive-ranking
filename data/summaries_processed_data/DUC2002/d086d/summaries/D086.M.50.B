Iraq, after first accusing Kuwait of wrongdoing, invaded its oil-rich neighbor with 100,000 tank-led troops.
It quickly overran the Kuwaiti capital and then continued on to southern oil facilities.
The United States led the United Nations in condemning this action and imposing tough economic and military sanctions.
