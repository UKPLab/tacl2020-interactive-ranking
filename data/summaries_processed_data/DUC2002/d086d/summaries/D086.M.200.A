Tension increased July 24-25 as the U.S. announced a "short-notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf and Iraq said it would not be intimidated by U.S. pressure.
Tension eased when Iraq and Kuwait agreed to talks, but by the time the parties met on July 31, Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border.
