The Iranian earthquake of June 21, 1990 which killed at least 50,000 and left 400,00 homeless elicited an outpouring of aid from around the world, both from countries friendly and from those hostile to Iran's Islamic government.
The assistance from the United States was such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80.
