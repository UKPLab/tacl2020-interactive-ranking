An earthquake measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale struck northern Iran shortly after midnight on Thursday, killing as many as 55,000 people and injuring 10's of thousands more.
The earthquake, which occurred in the mountainous area along Iran's coast, was the worst ever recorded in that area.
Humanitarian aid began to pour into the area as the Soviet Union sent a professional life saving team from Soviet Armenia, the sight of a devastating earthquake in 1988.
Although the United States broke diplomatic ties with Iran in 1979, Washington was arranging to provide humanitarian relief through the American Red Cross and other U.S. agencies.
Iran has said it would welcome such supplies.
An opposition group as accused the Iranian government underestimating the number of casualties and of devoting all of its resources to a war with Iran rather than providing adequate housing.
On the other hand, an anti-American newspaper in Iran said the U.S. was partly to blame because it caused the Iranians to divert needed cash from Housing projects and building earthquake resistant buildings.
This is the fourth largest earthquake in the world in the last 50 years.
The other three were in China in 1976, Soviet Turkmenia in 1948 and Peru in 1970.
