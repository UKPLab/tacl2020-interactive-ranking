America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards but in terms of hoopla and excitement, there's nothing akin to Britain's Booker Prize.
British publishers each submit three new titles for a total of approximately 100.
There's a jury of judges, including writers, academics, politicians, editors and critics.
Each juror reads every book and odds are given with reviews.
The jurors then meet and select six finalists.
Literary insiders bet on which book will win the Booker Prize.
The winner is announced at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, the seat the city's Lord Mayor, on the last Thursday in October.
The authors can win up to $38,000.
The event also guarantees great prestige and sales for the winner and brings the novel to public attention.
Critics say the brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype does a disservice to other gifted but unlisted authors.
On one recent occasion following heated deliberation between the judges, the chairman went public with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction.
The Prize, first awarded in 1969, is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books.
It is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business.
