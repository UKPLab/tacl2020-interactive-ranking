The northern California earthquake of October 17, 1989 caused extensive damage to buildings and roadways.
An official of the California Seismic Safety Commission said that assessing the disaster was "like the blind man trying to feel an elephant."
Another on-site observer commented that the quake "was like somebody slugging a punching bag.
Usually earthquakes pass, but this one went on and on...It was very very bad."
Estimates of the loss to insurers ranged from $2 billion to $4 billion.
Ironically, despite the record losses to insurers, insurance company stocks posted strong gains as investors bet that market forces and action by state regulators would result in higher insurance rates and long-term profits.
In Washington the Bush White House flew into a whirlwind of activity to show the administration's ability for rapid response.
In Sacramento Governor Deukmejian called a special session of the California legislature to deal with the disaster, but was perceived as blaming others for the collapse of freeways.
Critics called on him to stop pointing fingers and get on with reconstruction.
The Governor had earlier opposed an increase in the gasoline tax intended to augment transportation funding -- a step which appeared highly desirable after the quake left hundreds of thousands of commuters unable to reach work.
