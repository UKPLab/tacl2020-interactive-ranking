Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take place until April 1990.
The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the other 12 inches.
Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays.
It was named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is constantly expanding.
Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
A successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth.
On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed.
The HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight.
By April 28 there were still problems with the electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth on April 29, 1990.
