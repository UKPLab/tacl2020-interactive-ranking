President Aquino, successor to Marcos, has survived two major coup attempts and several mutinies.
She has faced political controversies, including opposition to an agrarian reform leader and a split with her Vice President.
In 1989 she refused to let Marcos, critically ill in Hawaii, to reenter the country, dead or alive.
