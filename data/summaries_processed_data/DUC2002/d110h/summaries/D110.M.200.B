Iraq ended its 1980-1988 war with Iran in debt for about $80 billion.
On July 17, 1990 Iraq provoked a major crisis by accusing Kuwait of costing it billions by exceeding Kuwait's OPEC assigned oil production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, by stealing Iraqi oil from a disputed border oil field, and also by demanding repayment of a $15 billion war debt.
After Egyptian and Saudi Arabian mediation failed, Iraq invaded Kuwait with 100,000 troops led by 350 tanks.
It quickly overran Kuwaiti defenses and continued south to the oil fields.
Kuwait leaders, including the emir, escaped to Saudi Arabia.
They appealed for U.S. military intervention.
The Pentagon diverted an aircraft carrier group toward the gulf.
A U.S. led U.N. resolution demanded that Iraq immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait.
Iraq responded that it invaded at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had already overthrown the government of Kuwait and this was not a U.N. matter.
The U.N. rejected this justification as a farce and imposed strong economic and military sanctions after Iraq failed to withdraw.
After a U.S. warning against invading Saudi Arabia, Iraq alerted its population to a possible U.S. attack.
