Here are some quotes on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait: ``The Iraqi government firmly believes and states that Iraq is pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations with Kuwait.
Furthermore, it is the Kuwaitis themselves who will determine their own future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon as order has been restored.''
Sabah Talat Kadrat, Iraq's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations.
``The pretext to invade an independent, sovereign state is a false, flimsy pretext.
This kind of pretext, if it's not going to be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august assembly, all international relations will be threatened.
No country at all will be safe after this.''
Mohammad Abulhasan, Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations.
``We remain committed to take whatever actions are necessary to defend our longstanding, vital interests in the (Persian) Gulf.''
President Bush, who said his advisers would ``consider all possible options available to us.''
