At dog shows throughout the world, proud owners compete their charges for the awards and glory that await the champions.
Prince, a fluffy, little Pomeranian, after winning at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden was honored at a lunch held at a Sardi's, a prominent New York City restaurant.
However, not all "famous" dogs are show dogs.
Sharing the limelight at Sardi's was Nero, New York City's top police dog.
Nero helped the police make hundreds of arrests and apprehend more than 50 felons.
And one need only look at the renown attained by photographer William Wegman's Weimaraners.
Artists worldwide know his dogs, as do children who watch "Sesame Street".
But it's the show dogs that crisscross the country to strut their stuff, sometimes as many as the 2,500 dogs representing 138 breeds that competed at the All Breed Dog Show and Obedience trials in Los Angeles.
Some may possibly go to Tel Aviv, Israel for its annual show.
Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler, works about 120 shows a year throughout the U.S., showing 20 to 25 dogs at each show.
Among those he shows is Kerrageen's Hotspur, the top award winning Kerry blue terrier of all time.
