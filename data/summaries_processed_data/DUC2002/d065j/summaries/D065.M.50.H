Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, George Bush's choice for vice-president in 1988, was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service and campaign gaffes attacked.
Quayle briefly worked for state officials after college, and met and married his wife Marilyn in law school.
They practiced law together before Quayle's 12 years in Congress.
