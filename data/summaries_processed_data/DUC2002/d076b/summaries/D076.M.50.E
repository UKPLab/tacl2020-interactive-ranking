The Iron Lady of British politics, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, retired on Thursday.
Her retirement, which took world leaders by surprise, followed a decision by her cabinet members not to support her in an upcoming vote.
Mrs. Thatcher served longer than any other prime minister in the 20th Century.
