Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida and Louisiana in August 1992 with winds ranging up to 165 miles per hour, killing 2 in the Bahamas, 15 in Florida, and 2 in Louisiana.
The greatest property damage was in Florida where a quarter of a million people were left homeless and 2 million were without power.
Property damage there exceeded $15 billion, most of it uninsured.
An early estimate set the total cost of the storm to insurers at more than $8 billion, but others forecast a total as high as $20 billion, mainly to U.S. insurers.
After local officials in Florida criticized delays in delivery of emergency supplies, the White House promised "dramatic" improvement within 24 hours and President Bush ordered troops to Florida.
The U.S. government estimated it would cost $20 billion to $30 billion to rebuild Florida and care for those displaced by the storm.
Fortunately Andrew did not hit low-lying New Orleans or off--shore oil facilities along the Gulf coast.
After the hurricane had passed an article in the "Financial Times" compared Andrew to a crisis in the value of the U.S. dollar which was "blowing itself out" during the course of the hurricane.
The comparison was inept.
