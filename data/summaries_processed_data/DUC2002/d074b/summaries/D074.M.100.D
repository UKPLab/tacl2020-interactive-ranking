Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of testimony, apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.
Several committee members say they expect the committee to recommend confirmation.
Thomas, a federal judge, was picked by President Bush to replace Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.
Supporters and opponents of the nomination representative conservative and liberal camps respectively.
Thomas is supported by conservative groups and opposed by abortion rights and civil rights groups.
He and his wife have opposed affirmative action programs, but during the hearings, Thomas refused to give his views on abortion.
