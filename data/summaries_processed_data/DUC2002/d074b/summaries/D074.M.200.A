From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, underwent five days of intensive questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although it seemed likely that the committee would vote to confirm the nomination, some members complained that the candidate refused to answer certain questions and seemed to back away from statements that he had made in the past.
By the end of the questioning it appeared that Thomas would be confirmed by a 10-4 or 9- 5 vote.
In the media Thomas's wife Virginia was presented as an issue.
Virginia had an impressive career as a lawyer in Washington, often taking strong conservative positions.
She is white while Clarence is black.
Women's-rights activists objected to her opposition to comparable-worth legislation; some religious groups were wary of her anti- cult activities; and some blacks viewed the Thomases' marriage as indicating his rejection of the black community.
Throughout the hearings the entire Senate came under pressure from groups supporting or opposing the nomination.
Pro-Thomas groups included the Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and Society and the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas.
Opposing were the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
