On Tuesday, April 24, 1990, shuttle Discovery carried the 12.5-ton Hubble Space Telescope 380 miles into space.
Once in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble would be able to see 10 times better than the largest Earth telescopes.
Wednesday it was lifted into space by Discovery's mechanical arm and released into orbit.
Friday the 94.5-inch mirror was exposed to starlight.
Saturday controllers took Hubble out of safe mode.
Problems with a solar power array, communications antennas, and two position- stabilizing gyroscopes -- exacerbated by conservative limits set on systems -- put Hubble several days behind schedule and delayed transmittal of the first photograph.
Discovery's astronauts -- Shriver, Bolden, Hawley, McCandless, and Sullivan - - were all veterans of previous flights.
The shuttle followed Hubble for two days to assist if necessary.
A seven- month checkout period would follow.
Spacelab Astro was to be put up two weeks later to give Hubble additional target information.
Hubble, delayed since 1983, cost $1.5 billion.
Spare parts, training, and software cost $500 million more.
Maintenance cost $7 million a month on Earth and will cost $200 million yearly in orbit, for Hubble's 15-year lifetime.
Discovery carried the Hooker Telescope eyepiece used by astronomer Edwin Hubble, for whom the Hubble is named.
