The deadliest earthquake in this region since 1950 hit near the Nepal-India border.
At least 750 people died and thousands were injured.
The magnitude 6.5 quake, lasting about 40 seconds and with its epicenter about 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, Nepal, was felt as far away as New Delhi, Calcutta and northern Bangladesh.
The hardest hit areas were the Dharan district of Nepal, where 50,000 to 60,000 houses were destroyed and the Bihar state of India.
With cracks in the embankments of six Bihar state rivers, flooding could be the next threat there.
Aftershocks kept people terrified for days.
The army, police, and local inhabitants are taking part in rescue efforts in both countries.
Foreign aid began arriving.
Earthquake damage and monsoon rains have paralyzed rail and road transportation thus hindering rescue efforts and isolating some remote areas.
Nepalese police bulldozed more than 50 houses considered too unsafe to be habitable.
Concerned American parents heard from some of their Peace Corps volunteer children in Nepal where all but three volunteers have been tracked down.
And in Bhaktapur, Nepal, political rivals of a former legislator accused him of distributing relief supplies to only his supporters and beat him to death.
