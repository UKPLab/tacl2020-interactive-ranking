The McMartin Pre-School molestation trial ended Thursday without any convictions.
Reactions to the verdict were strong, ranging from tears to finger pointing.
The case began in 1983 and became a media-fed witch-hunt ending with the longest, costliest criminal trial in history.
It will continue to reverberate in civil courts, bookstores and on television.
