Since September 10, Hurricane Gilbert has cut a destructive path through the Caribbean, hitting Jamaica and the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico with its full force.
Gilbert became the third hurricane of the 1988 season on Saturday.
On Sunday, it passed south of the Greater Antilles, causing flooding, power outages, and airport closures, and knocking down trees and tearing off roofs in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.
In the Dominican Republic, five were killed and 10 inches of rain fell.
The eye of the storm hit Kingston, Jamaica, on Monday, then moved lengthwise across the island, at about 17 mph with sustained winds of 155 mph, causing extensive damage.
Nineteen were killed in Jamaica.
The storm buffeted the Cayman Islands, then struck the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel on the Yucatan with winds of 160 mph.
Power and communications were cut, flooding was extensive, and bands of youths began looting in Cancun.
By midnight, Gilbert was northeast of the Yucatan and heading for the Gulf of Mexico.
Gilbert was an extremely intense storm, attaining the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
Forecasters remain baffled by why this trough became such a ferocious storm.
