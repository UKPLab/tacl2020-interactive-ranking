Tropical Storm Gilbert strengthened into an eastern Caribbean hurricane on Saturday night, September 10, 1988.
Government officials of the island nations in its westerly path issued alerts, warnings and orders to evacuate their southerly-exposed coastal areas.
Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican escaped with only some coastal flooding and a few deaths before Gilbert continued on to strike Jamaica with 110mph winds and torrential rains.
The storm, now one of the largest systems seen in the Caribbean for a long time, slowly traversed the length of the island causing massive damage and nineteen deaths.
100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes were destroyed leaving 500,000 people homeless.
The storm then passed over the Cayman Islands located south of Cuba.
Cuba and our American military bases there both avoided the brunt of the storm before it slammed full force into the Yucatan Peninsula.
By now Gilbert had strengthened into the most severe hurricane ever recorded with barometric pressure of 26.31 inches and sustained winds of 179mph, gusting to 218mph.
Relief efforts for the heavily damaged Cancun and Cozumel areas were hindered due to massive flooding and power and phone outages.
Scientists do not fully understand why some minor tropical storms strengthen into hurricanes, while others do not.
