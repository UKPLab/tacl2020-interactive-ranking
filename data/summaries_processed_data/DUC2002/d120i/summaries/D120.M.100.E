At 47, John Major became Britain's youngest prime minister.
His accession to power followed the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following a challenge by former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine to her leadership.
Major fell two votes shy of a victory in an election with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Heseltine but both opponents quickly conceded to Major.
Since his election, Major has been seen as weak and indecisive.
He is an unpopular leader whose cabinet has been rocked by scandal and who reneged on campaign promises.
Adding to his unpopularity is the recession which continues plague Britain.
