John Major was 47 when he was elected to lead the Conservative Party.
Assuming the position of prime Minister from Margaret, Mr. Major became the youngest prime minister since the 19th century.
Mr. Major was confirmed as leader of the Conservative Party when his two opponents, former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, conceded defeat in an election which saw Major two votes shy of a majority.
Major, whose father was a trapeze artist in the circus, overcame many obstacles in his rise to the top.
He was a high school drop out and for a time was a welfare recipient.
Mr. Major had little time to enjoy his victory as public opinion of him soon soured.
While seen as gentler than his abrasive predecessor, he is viewed as timid and indecisive.
Almost from the first he has been beset by scandal in his cabinet and a number of controversies ranging from internal party differences over Europe to the debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System to a deep and continuing recession.
Major came out in strong support of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, calling on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
