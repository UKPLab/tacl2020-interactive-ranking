Medical advances combined with lifestyle changes have combined to significantly reduce the number and severity of heart attacks in the past decade.
New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack.
Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs.
The FDA warns that further tests with aspirin are required.
Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure.
Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack.
Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.
Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery.
Other factors in the reduction in heart attacks are changes in diet and smoking fewer cigarettes.
