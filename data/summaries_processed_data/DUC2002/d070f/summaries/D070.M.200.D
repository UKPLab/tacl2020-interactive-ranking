Erich Honecker, former head of East Germany, died on 29 May 1994 in Santiago Chile.
He and his wife Margot had been living with their daughter in Santiago since his release from prison in 1993.
Honecker and the Communist regime he headed, were toppled in October 1989 by pro-democracy demonstrators, leading to the eventual unification of Germany.
He along with several members of his Politburo were arrested and charged with treason, corruption and abuse of power.
Honecker was also charged with manslaughter, stemming from his shoot-to-kill order, which resulted in the deaths of East Germans attempting to flee to the West.
Honecker had been seriously ill since his downfall and had spent much time in hospital and under house arrest.
Honecker ruled East Germany for 18 years using his secret police, known as Stasi, which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept a tight rein on the population.
As protests gathered strength in the fall of 1989, Honecker "lost touch with reality" according to former members of his regime.
Club swinging police brutally beat demonstrators, when Soviet President Gorbachev was in town to commemorate the country's 40th anniversary.
The uprising was a turning point that speeded Honecker's downfall days later.
