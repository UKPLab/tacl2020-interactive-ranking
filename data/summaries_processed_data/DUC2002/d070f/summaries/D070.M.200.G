Former East German leader Erich Honecker was under house arrest outside East Berlin since being ousted in October 1989.
Honecker and other party officials have been investigated for corruption and treason.
After hospitalization for kidney surgery, he was arrested and imprisoned to await trial.
Judged too ill for imprisonment but fit enough for prosecution, he was placed in a Soviet East Berlin hospital.
In August, Honecker was interrogated about his role in the killing of some 200 people trying to escape from East Berlin.
A murder charge would put him away for life.
His trial was delayed because of East German-West German merger negotiations.
In December, Soviet authorities refused to return him to Germany claiming it would "burden" Moscow and Bonn's "outstanding relations."
In December 1991, Honecker took refuge in the Chilean Embassy in Moscow.
Gorbachev was his protector until his political fortunes declined and he ordered Honecker to leave the country.
He was tried and imprisoned in Germany in early 1992 but was released in 1993.
He traveled to Santiago, Chile to join his daughter who had married a Chilean.
He lived with his wife in a wealthy Santiago area where he died in 1994 at age 81.
