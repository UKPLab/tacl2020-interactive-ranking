In the world of international competition, the Olympics are special.
True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.
But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.
Sometimes dreams of Olympic gold are dashed, as happened to U.S. figure skater Debi Thomas, who, expecting gold, only placed third.
National pride is a factor.
The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.
The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.
However, among those "third-most" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner- Kersee.
Unfortunately, at these games Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was disgraced by having his gold medal stripped away because of drug use.
The Olympics can lead to material wealth, such as experience by 1984 gymnast pixie, Mary Lou Retton or to long- lasting fame such as that of Jesse Owens, the black American who in the 1936 Berlin Olympics put to the lie Adolph Hitler's theories of a master race.
