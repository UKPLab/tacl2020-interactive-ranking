On June 3, 1989 at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing marching toward Tiananmen Square to dislodge student pro-democracy demonstrators who had encamped there for three weeks.
Within 28 hours the students were dispersed at a cost in lives estimated by the Chinese government at 300-400, by officials of the Chinese Red Cross as 2,600, and by others as between 3,000 and 12,000.
The crisis was not at an end, however, as soldiers continued random shooting of civilians and rival factions of the Chinese army started shooting at one another.
During June 5-9 governments around the world condemned the brutal suppression advising their nationals to leave Beijing.
Chinese abroad mourned the dead.
Anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities.
The pro-democracy movement had its origin with the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989.
By April 17 thousands of students marched in Beijing and Shanghai shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang!
Long live democracy!"
The protest movement focused on Tiananmen Square when 2,000 students began a hunger strike there and a million citizens rallied to their support.
When declaration of martial law did not intimidate the protesters the government resorted to the massive use of troops and firepower.
