American Insurance Service Group says Hurricane Hugo, which ravaged the Caribbean and the Carolinas last week, is responsible for record hurricane losses.
State Farm Insurance expects claims of approximately $500 million in the Carolinas.
Nationwide Insurance is projecting claims near $100 million.
Though the Hugo-related losses are substantial, most companies have sufficient funds to cover them.
Some companies, however, will reduce third-quarter earnings.
Hugo slammed into Charleston Thursday night with top winds of 135 mph.
Upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane hours before it struck the historic city, it caused widespread damage throughout the Carolinas.
Only two lives were lost in Charleston, however, and only 17 total in South Carolina.
Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who monitored the hurricane and evacuated.
Computer models at the National Hurricane Center used satellite information to track Hugo's path into Charleston.
Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, the governor declared a state of emergency and National Guardsmen were ordered to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront.
Thousands fled inland or went to shelters.
Kingston, New York, assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War, is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover.
