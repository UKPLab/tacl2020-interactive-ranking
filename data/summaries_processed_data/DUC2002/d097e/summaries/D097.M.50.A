Hurricane Hugo which hit Charleston, S.C. head-on the night of Sept. 21, 1989 was the costliest storm in the city's 300-year history.
Despite widespread devastation (insured losses approached $5 billion) there were only 17 deaths in South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself thanks to accurate forecasting in time for an effective evacuation.
