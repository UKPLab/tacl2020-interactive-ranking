A powerful cold front moved through the eastern half of the United States on November 15 and 16, carving a deadly path of destruction.
The abnormally warm air preceding the front spawned tornados, violent thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall.
Tornados struck in at least seven states.
Hardest hit was Huntsville, Alabama, where a tornado roared down a major street near rush hour, leveling a shopping district, apartment development, and elementary school.
Seventeen were killed, 463 injured, and 1000 left homeless.
Witnesses recall a huge roar, water and winds, screaming, hiding, and helping others.
Roads were blocked and power and telephone lines were cut.
Rescuers, including National Guard troops, worked all night sifting through the rubble.
Damages were estimated at $100 million, with about $1 million needed to provide emergency clothing and temporary housing.
President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area.
Marilyn Quayle, wife of the Vice President, toured the area with Alabama's governor and senators on November 18.
Near Newburgh, New York high winds caused an elementary school cafeteria to cave in on November 16.
Seven children were killed and 18 injured.
A truck driver also was killed in New Jersey and a woman died in Illinois.
Injuries occurred in five other states.
