He killed five children and wounded 29 others and a teacher, then killed himself.
All the dead and 19 of the wounded were children of Southeast Asian refugees, as were 60% of the school's 970 students.
Translators and Buddhist priests assisted families, who received financial aid from the county victim assistance program.
Students returning to school received counseling.
A South Carolina school where a similar attack occurred sent encouragement.
