Tuberculosis (TB) was killing 3 million people worldwide in 1990 and increasing in Latvia in 1993.
By 1990 the number of cases in the U.S. stopped declining.
AIDS patients, prisoners, blacks, office workers, and the homeless, undernourished, or seriously ill are more susceptible.
Testing, treatment, and building ventilation need to be improved.
