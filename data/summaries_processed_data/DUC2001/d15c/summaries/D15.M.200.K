The decline in the tuberculosis rate in the United States had stopped, while internationally it was reported to be the world's deadliest disease by 1990, killing three million annually.
The prevalence of AIDS, which impairs the immune system, was blamed.
Three million reportedly had both AIDS and TB, and TB was by then epidemic in American inner cities.
New York and Newark both reported alarming increases in their tuberculosis rate, and both cities responded with programs of testing and treatment.
AIDS experts reported that while progress was being made on a preventive vaccine, control of AIDS was already possible with existing drugs.
TB was reportedly readily responsive to an inexpensive drug treatment even to those with AIDS.
Crowded prisons reported TB rates three times higher than on the outside, and officials urged testing and treatment, including isolation of symptomatic cases.
A study in Arkansas nursing homes demonstrated that blacks were more likely to contract TB than whites in identical situations.
The study suggested a genetic predisposition.
Office buildings, airplanes, hospitals and prisons, all with little or no circulation of fresh air, were shown as likely places for airborne infections such as TB to spread.
Latvia reported a sizable increase in TB cases in 1993.
