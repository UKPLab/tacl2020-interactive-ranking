Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease caused by bacteria transmitted through the air when infected people sneeze or cough.
The morbidity rate of the disease was on a decline from the 1950s until the late 1970s or early 1980s.
Public health officials and health organizations recognized that the rate of decline had slowed, and by the mid-1980s it was increasing at an alarming rate.
By 1990 the World Health Organization, a United Nations Agency, said that tuberculosis was the world's deadliest infectious disease, killing three million a year.
The incidence of tuberculosis varied from region to region, from country to country, and in the United States, from state to state.
Tuberculosis was running rampant in Sub- Saharan Africa, an area where in earlier times it had not been a problem.
It was also increasing in Latin America and Southeast Asia.
Even in Latvia, where it might seem out of place, the morbidity rose by 14 percent from 1992 to 1993.
The figures for 1989 illustrate how the occurrence of tuberculosis varied in the United States.
There was a five percent overall increase for the nation.
No new cases were reported in Wyoming, but New Jersey had a 35 percent increase in reported cases.
The connection between AIDS and tuberculosis was the single most important factor in turning tuberculosis from a declining disease to one of epidemic proportions.
This was true in the poorer areas of the world, and especially in Africa.
It is estimated that from one-seventh to one-tenth of the world's population carry the tuberculosis bacterium.
They can carry it for a lifetime without becoming ill.
When body defenses are weakened, as they are with AIDS, the latent bacteria might mutate into full-blown tuberculosis.
Besides being at risk themselves, the AIDS patients with tuberculosis transmit it to others.
Researchers have found that prisoners are three times more likely to have tuberculosis than those on the outside.
Modern airtight buildings with ventilators that circulate stale air are sources of tuberculosis.
Socioeconomic conditions have always been perceived as the reason that blacks in the United States are six times more likely than whites to contract tuberculosis.
An extensive study concluded that blacks are genetically more at risk, and all conditions being equal, blacks would still be twice as likely as whites to have the disease.
