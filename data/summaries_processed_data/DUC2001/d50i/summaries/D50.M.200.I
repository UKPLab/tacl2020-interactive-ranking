In 1988, at least 29% of the nation was hit by a drought.
Nationally the drought was about equal to the one in 1911.
Procedures were implemented to increase animal feed and sales of meat.
Other areas of concern were exporting grains, loan defaults, sales of farm machinery, land sales and rising food prices.
In August 1988, Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought relief bill.
An Agriculture Department survey had predicted that grain production would be 31% smaller than 1987.
The aid package did reduce loses and stave off bankruptcies in the drought ravaged states.
But, according to the Associated Press, this election year package provided money to one-quarter of all American farmers, even those who didn't need it, and some banks, corporations, churches and local governments.
A 1990 postmortem of the drought revealed that it was not as bad as it could have been.
Although net farm incomes in drought areas decreased, the number of financially vulnerable farms also continued to decrease.
Late 1988 research and computer modeling, suggested that the drought was caused by changes in the weather pattern created by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.
