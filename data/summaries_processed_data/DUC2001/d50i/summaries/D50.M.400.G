In June 1988, the Reagan administration moved to deal with a drought plaguing much of the nation.
An interagency group was appointed, although there was no prediction as to what kind of relief might be authorized.
The Administration was concerned about curbing its export enhancement plan.
Bankers worried about borrowers' financial help.
Farm equipment makers were concerned about sales.
Farmers worried about cash shortage whose effects could ripple throughout the farm economy.
The Agriculture Department said it had been on top of the drought since March 1; monitoring the situation, setting up hotlines, and issuing a "USDA Backgrounder" updated every two weeks listing the Department's "drought-related" actions.
By mid-July, the drought had shifted eastward from the Rockies to the Mid-Atlantic with little relief in sight.
29% of the nation was undergoing severe drought.
In August, the Agriculture Department confirmed that the drought would curtail the Fall corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher prices for years to come.
However, crop stockpiles were so high that there was no fear of shortages on grocery shelves or discontinuance of food exporting.
Also, President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought relief program to help farmers survive to plant the next Spring.
A new computer study reported at the end of 1988 that the drought in the Midwest might have been caused, April through June, by ocean temperature abnormalities near the Pacific equator.
By the end of 1989, the $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988 became an unexpected election-year windfall for thousands of farmers, when cash was paid far beyond original intent to save them from bankruptcy.
The program broadened at each step, adding hail, flood, heat, insect, wind, and fungus damage.
Loose regulations, lax enforcement, and politicians trying to be recognized in an election year as friends of farmers were the main reasons for the generosity.
The 1988 drought hit hardest in the upper Midwest where most of the aid went to North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state, which lost two-thirds of its hard-red Spring wheat crop.
Despite the overly generous relief aid, money did reach areas that Congress most intended to aid, where it kept farmers on their land and might have prevented some business closures.
A late 1990 Agriculture Department analysis of nine "drought region" prices rose and farm solvency still improved.
