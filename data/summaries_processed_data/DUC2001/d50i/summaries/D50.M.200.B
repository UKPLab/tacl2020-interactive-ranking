In 1988, the United States experienced one of the century's worst droughts.
In the Midwest, large areas suffered their driest April-June period since 1895.
The USDA set up hotlines for callers and issued informational statements listing drought related actions taken by the department.
Two early actions were to buy meat for school cafeterias and to extend credit for Mexico to buy meat.
These purchases helped livestock markets, which were depressed due to the drought-induced liquidation of herds.
Drought counties were allowed to conduct emergency haying and grazing of Acreage Conservation Reserve (ACR) and Conservation Use Acreage (CUA) lands.
Later, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land was also opened.
Congress passed a record $3.9 billion drought relief bill.
North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state, received $410.2 million, about 10.5 percent of the total package.
The money helped more than 49,000 farmers in the state and the trickle-down effect also reduced statewide losses to farm dependent businesses.
North Dakota, along with Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin received nearly half of the allocated aid.
A 1990 study showed that despite the drought, high commodity prices enabled farms to improve their solvency in 1988.
And the number of farms considered financially vulnerable also decreased.
