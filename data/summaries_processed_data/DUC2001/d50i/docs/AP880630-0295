The Agriculture Department says it has been on top of the drought since March 1, monitoring the situation, setting up hotlines to handle worried callers and issuing enough statements to paper a thousand bird cages, easy.
One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDA Backgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions'' since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of the nation.
``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quipped Sally Michael, the department's deputy director of information.
``This helps me keep track of what we've done.''
Michael agreed during questioning by a reporter that the action list is lean on actual dollars going into the drought aid.
Only two items had dollar amounts.
One involved meat purchases for school cafeterias and the other a credit deal for the sale of meat to Mexico.
The backgrounders will be updated every two weeks.
The first lists 22 separate drought ``actions'' by USDA or its people, beginning more than four months ago.
First item: ``March 1.
Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng establishes USDA Drought Task Force under the chairmanship of Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers.
Members agency administrators and key USDA personnel will constantly monitor the potential drought situation.''
The blurb also gave the number of the USDA press release that formally announced the task force creation, but not its date.
In reality, though the drought panel was set up by Lyng on March 1, the press release announcing the action was not issued until April 22.
Department officials questioned at the time said they attached no significance to keeping the task force secret for seven weeks before announcing it.
Excerpts from other USDA actions cited by the report: May 31.
