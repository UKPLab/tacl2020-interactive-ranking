America's 1988 drought captured attention everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history.
The Associated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and found the money spread far beyond the drought.
The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.
An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.
Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy, an effort supported by almost everyone that simply grew and grew and grew.
At each step, the program was broadened.
Congress began with a bill to aid drought victims.
The lawmakers added hail to the relief package.
Then floods.
Next came ``heat,'' an addition from the Agriculture Department.
By the time checks were being written at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ``ineffective herbicide.''
None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible, administrators in Washington say.
Nothing in federal procedures, however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for routine approval or checking.
By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states.
The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion.
``We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,'' said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.
Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.
The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure.
``Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,'' said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.
``(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.''
In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility requirements exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for example their requests for aid were approved anyway by local officials.
Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous program.
As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said.
``It was there, so I took it,'' said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.
Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program.
Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program.
``Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,'' said Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for the Agriculture Department.
``What percentage, we don't know.
But that is part of the beast I guess that was created.
Whenever you do this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.''
The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.
Those growers profited by ``triple-dipping'': reaping crop insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting the same ground for a successful harvest all perfectly legal under the 1988 program.
Disaster payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers.
In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.
Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of $3 billion, received a check through its energy division.
The American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas AM University and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the Jesuit order.
Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.
Wrong, say Washington officials the ceiling applies to revenue from all operations.
Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.
In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million.
In Iowa the aid, calculated by the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.
Without that money, ``it would have meant substantially more losses to Main Street,'' Cochran said.
``Drought legislation saved businesses from having to close their doors.''
To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database.
From those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.
Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual farms' participation in the program, were requested for about 12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.
Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA.
One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000 acres near Levelland.
Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.
Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance.
And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with milo and made a good crop.
According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.
``I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for me,'' Gresham said.
``You can't farm without the government.
You play their game.''
