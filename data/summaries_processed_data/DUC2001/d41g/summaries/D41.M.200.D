Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past two weeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer because they will stimulate the growth of grasses that later dry and become fuel for wildfires.
Unless an unusually cool summer intervenes, this summer could become one of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history.
Firefighters are most concerned about rural areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people have built homes among heavy vegetation.
In 1988 drought conditions and high winds help make it the worst year in hundreds of years for wildfires.
The U.S. Forest service said 5 million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone National Park.
Wildfires are a major environmental concern but they also put at risk the 80,000 men and women that battle the wildfires.
Their health is under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke.
Health experts suspect that exposure to that smoke may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma.
As this summer's wildfire season approaches, firefighters are wondering not whether, but only where and when.
