Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past two weeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer because they will stimulate the growth of grasses.
The grasses will turn paper-dry by July helping to spread fires quickly through trees and brush killed and weakened by five consecutive years of drought and by insects which more easily invade dry wood than moist.
The December freeze in California killed heavy brush and millions of trees that are now primed to burn.
Unless an unusually cool summer intervenes, these are the ingredients for what could become one of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history.
Firefighters are most concerned about rural areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people have built homes among heavy vegetation.
While little can be done to control the natural fires that occur, homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve the chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire.
While no plant is fireproof, some are more flammable than others.
A line of defense against fire can be designed into landscaping by carefully selecting the plants that that will go in the garden around the home.
In 1988 drought conditions and high winds help make it the worst year in hundreds of years for wildfires.
The U.S. Forest service said 5 million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone National Park.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires.
Despite the infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces, most of the pristine landscape in Yellowstone emerged unscathed.
Wildfires are a major environmental concern but they also put at risk the 80,000 men and women that battle the wildfires.
Their health is under siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke.
Among the culprits are carbon monoxide, which slows reaction and impairs judgement; microscopic particles of carbon that lodge in the lungs; aldehydes and acids that irritate air passages, hydrocarbon-bases substances and other chemicals that can damage genes and cause cancer, test show.
Health experts also suspect that exposure to wildfire smoke may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma.
As this summer's wildfire season approaches, firefighters are wondering not whether, but only where and when.
