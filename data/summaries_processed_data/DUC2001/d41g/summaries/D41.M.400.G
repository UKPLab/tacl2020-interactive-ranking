Fire is a natural part of Western forest and rangeland.
However, some years are worse than others.
Drought conditions, high winds, and a tremendous build-up of tinder helped make the 1988 fires the worst in a hundred years.
Nearly 1.5 million acres burned in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the National Park.
Residents of the northeastern corner of the Park were threatened to be burned out.
Eventually, millions of dollars, thousands of man-hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved the area.
The Forest and National Park Services spent a combined $300 million fighting the fires.
The House Agriculture Committee has planned hearings for next year into how the US Forest Service handled the wildfires, focusing on fire-fighting policies, area rehabilitation, and scientific research on the fires.
Arguments rage on the impact of fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes, and the role of the media in giving the impression that a national treasure had burned to cinders.
The Interior Department, in response, has ordered a moratorium on its potentially sensitive "let-burn" policy.
The 1989 fire season also started to gear up with firefighters in five Western states battling hundreds of blazes, most started by lightning.
Strategists and quartermasters at the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho direct the nation's wildfire battles.
Specialists marshal resources from around the nation and track the fires.
New studies show the men and women who battle wildfires face an unseen hazard from the smoke--effects from poisonous gasses and soot, acceleration of aging, heart attacks, and respiratory diseases.
Overly heavy gear and inadequate filters are also a problem.
Because of a five-year drought and rains that nurture grass now turning dry, California geared up for a dangerous wildfire season in 1991.
Firefighters were most concerned about rural areas.
Residents have been advised to take special precautions; notably, clearing a 30-foot defensible space of dry grass and brush from around the house.
In Santa Barbara, California, the idea of firescaping--fire-resistant landscaping--has been introduced.
Xeriscaping--landscaping with local drought tolerant plants--is becoming commonplace.
Officials in the San Francisco Bay area have identified local areas that have community problems with the greatest potential for a firestorm; namely, a preponderance of wood homes and a mix of dense homes and dry forest.
Firefighters complain overall that moving into wooded seclusion and natural beauty exacts a cost in fire protection.
