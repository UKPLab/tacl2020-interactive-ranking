Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE, is commonly known as "mad cow disease".
The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims, and in its later stages causes the animals to act jittery and unstable.
The symptoms are similar to those seen in sheep that suffer from a disease known as scrapie.
The sheep version has been around since the 1700s, but it was first diagnosed in cows in 1986.
British government experts say that processed feed that includes the remains of diseased sheep has caused the spread of the cow disease.
They say that a certain rendering process allows the infective agent to survive and victimize the cattle.
The feed was banned in 1988, but the disease continued to strike.
The government said that was because farmers continued to use contaminated feed after it had been outlawed.
Some scientists outside the government and segments of the public refuted the government's claim.
The spongiform disease has cost the British government several millions of dollars in compensation to farmers whose cows were destroyed.
As of March 1994 nearly 122,000 cows had been destroyed, and early on the government promised the farmers 100% of the market value of each cow destroyed as a preventive measure.
The 3.7 billion dollar British beef industry was threatened by bans on the importation of British beef into the United States and six other countries.
By 1994 Germany was asking the European Union for permission to impose a complete ban on importation of British beef.
Strains of the spongiform disease have been found in species other than sheep and cows.
Those include the antelope, the domestic cat and the larger cheetah and puma.
The spread to other species exacerbated the vocal protests of the British public who were concerned that humans could be affected.
A rare human disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or CJD, is similar to BSE.
Most scientists insist that there is no evidence has been developed that links BSE and CJD, but the 1993 deaths of two British dairy farmers who suffered with CJD added to the public's unrest.
An outbreak of CJD in an area of Slovakia where sheep abound added to the drive to study the connection, if any, between the human and animal diseases.
American researchers studied a strange disease among New Guinea tribesmen that gave victim's brains a spongy appearance, and German researchers mounted an expensive effort to study the BSE-CJD link.
