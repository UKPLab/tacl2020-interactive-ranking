Efforts of the British government to wipe out "mad cow disease" proved unsuccessful during the period 1986-1994.
A ban on use of sheep offal in cattle feed and extensive destruction of infected cattle (120,00 by 1994) seemed to have little effect.
The similarity of the disease to a rarely seen fatal human ailment (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) led to the fear that humans might be infected by cattle or by eating beef.
Scientists discounted this fear but more research was needed to dispel it.
Germany began conducting such research while at the same time discussing a ban on import of British beef.
