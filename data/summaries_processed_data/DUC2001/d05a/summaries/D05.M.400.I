Spongiform encephalopathies consist of a family of related diseases, which after a very long incubation period eat holes in the brains of their victims before killing them.
Researchers believe these diseases are caused by a prion, an abnormal form of a protein normally present in the brain.
The first know disease was scrapies, which attacks sheep and has been in Britain since the 1700's.
In 1986 "mad cow disease" was first diagnosed in cattle that had been eating feed containing sheep by-products.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) afflicts man.
Although rare and thought to appear randomly, it has appeared in clusters among sheep growers in Slovakia, New Guinean cannibals, some patients who received growth hormones, and individuals carrying a genetic defect.
In 1994, the German government began studies to search for connections between "mad cow" and CJD and the similar Gerstmann Straussler syndrome.
Fears grew as more cattle in United Kingdom (UK) died from "mad cow disease."
Ten thousand cattle had been destroyed by 1990, 1,000 new cases were being discovered each week in 1993, and more than 120,00 cattle in the UK had died by March 1994.
Other victims of this disease include goats, house cats, wild cats, minks in the U.S., and various types of African antelopes being raised in captivity in Britain.
The kudu appeared to be especially susceptible, with five (only one of which could have eaten contaminated food) of eight born after 1987 dead by 1994.
The kudu deaths and deaths of cattle born after the sheep by-product feed was banned created questions on how the disease is being spread.
Some theorize cow to calf transmission is possible or blame pesticides.
In 1990, with fears that "mad cow disease" could spread to humans and with hopes to limit the disease to the UK (where beef consumption had dropped drastically), the U.S. and six other countries banned import of British cattle and their embryos and semen, and the European Community proposed a ban on imports of live British cattle.
By 1994, after the deaths of two British dairy farmers to CJD (a statistical improbability) and deaths of 50 Swiss and 2 German cattle to "mad cow disease", Germany proposed a ban of importation of any live cattle or beef from Britain.
The health ministers of the European Union were to discuss the issue.
Belgium joined the UK in supporting the operative restrictions as adequate.
Since 1986, the UK had struggled to sustain the devastated cattle industry.
