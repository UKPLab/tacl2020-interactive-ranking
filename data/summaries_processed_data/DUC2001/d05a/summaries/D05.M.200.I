Researchers believe spongiform encephalopathy (SE) diseases are caused by an abnormal protein (prion), which, after a long incubation period, eats holes in the brain.
The first SE disease (scrapies) has attacked British sheep since the 1700's.
In 1986 "mad cow disease" was diagnosed in cattle that had eaten feed containing sheep by-products.
By 1994 more than 120,00 cattle and a few other animals--including cats and African antelope--had died in the UK from "mad cow."
Since tainted feed was banned years ago, researchers continued to search for other transmission methods.
Two SE diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, rarely afflict man, but researchers are looking for connections, especially a feared causal relationship, with "mad cow disease."
By 1990, beef consumption had dropped drastically in the UK and the U.S. and six other countries banned import of British cattle and their embryos and semen.
By 1994, after the deaths of two British dairy farmers to CJD (a statistical improbability) and "mad cow disease" deaths in European cattle, Germany proposed a ban on importing live cattle or beef from Britain.
European Union health ministers were to discuss the ban, but the UK, fighting to save the British beef industry, maintained operative restrictions were adequate.
