Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease", was diagnosed in cows in 1986.
A similar disease was seen much earlier in sheep.
Use of contaminated feed was cited as the cause for the disease's proliferation in cows.
By 1994 the disease in Britain had killed 122,00 cows.
A rare human disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or CJD, has symptoms similar to BSE.
The 1993 deaths of two British dairy farmer stricken with CJD alarmed the British public.
There is great interest regarding the link, if any, between CJD and BSE, and it is being studied in America, Czechoslovakia and Germany.
