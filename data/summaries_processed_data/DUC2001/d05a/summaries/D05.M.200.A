After the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "madcow disease" in Britain in 1986 the British government tried to contain the epidemic but the number of cases increased over the next eight years.
More than 120,000 cattle were lost.
Other countries placed embargoes on cattle from Britain and by 1994 Germany was threatening to ban any importation of British beef.
BSE is similar to a common ovine malady (scrapie) and, more importantly, to another form of spongiform encephalopathy that occurs rarely among humans: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
All three of these forms are invariably fatal.
The cause is an abnormal form of protein in the brain, prion, that converts protein into its abnormal form.
The mode of transmission of CJD is unknown.
Publicized cases of CJD appearing among sheep herders and dairy farmers led many to believe that perhaps humans catch the disease from cattle with BSE or from sheep with scrapie or from eating beef or lamb.
Most scientists say there is no evidence to support this belief, but it has gained wide currency and will probably persist until research gives a better explanation.
In 1994 the German government announced a far-reaching program to study whether BSE can be transmitted to humans.
