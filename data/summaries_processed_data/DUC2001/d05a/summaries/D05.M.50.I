From 1986 to 1994, more than 120,000 cattle and a few other creatures in the UK died from "mad cow disease," which is caused by an abnormal protein.
The British cattle industry was under siege, while many nations were imposing or discussing bans on imports, fearing "mad cow" could be transmitted to humans.
