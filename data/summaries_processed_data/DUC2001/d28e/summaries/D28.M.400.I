Marathon racing was a popular sport from 1989 to 1991.
The race, 26.2 miles long, usually includes competition by men, women, and both sexes in wheelchairs, and sometimes is run in conjunction with shorter races, such as half marathons.
Half marathons alone also are run.
The wheelchair winners have the best times--under 2 hours, with the men's winner usually finishing 10 to 15 minutes later, and the women's winner about 20 minutes after that.
The winning finishing times in individual city marathons vary by as much as 5 minutes, depending on the quality of the competitors, terrain, and weather for the day.
Prize money for these winners varies widely.
The 1989 Chicago marathon paid $50,000 to the men's and women's winners.
The San Diego International Marathon, the same year, paid each only $5,000.
The Boston Marathon in 1991 had $402,000 in total prize money.
Competitors in U.S. marathons come from all over the world.
African nations, especially Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, have contributed many winning male runners.
Ethiopians are especially successful because they train at high altitudes to enhance aerobic capacity.
On one April 1989 weekend, Ethiopians won three major marathons.
Mexican runners also are especially successful, as are Northern European women.
One of the two fastest female marathoners, as of 1991, was from Norway.
She won the 1989 Boston Marathon, finishing 26th overall, which was believed to be the highest overall finish for a woman in this race.
Asian runners, male and female, are strong in West Coast races.
The professionals are by no means the only participants.
Races draw thousands of runners.
Thirteen thousand were expected for the 1991 Boston Marathon.
One of them was an 83 year-old man who would be running his 60th Boston Marathon.
He won the race in 1935 and 1945 and finished second seven times.
His time in 1990 was 5 hours and 5 minutes.
Amateur interest in marathon racing is strong and can be unusual.
In 1990 a naval officer on a battleship deployed in the Middle East planned to run his marathon in 75 laps around the deck, while his wife and father ran the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C. Marathon vacations became popular by the early 1990's.
Tour companies offered clients marathon packages including airfare, hotel, and race entries to locations throughout the world.
One company took 5,500 people on 20 different tours in 1990.
Choice locations included European cities and Bermuda.
