The world of marathon running is full of stories of success, failure and excitement.
The Boston Marathon has been the scene of a number of these stories.
John Kelley is an 83-year-old icon of this race and he is about to enter his 60th marathon.
In the past, this marathon has turned into a speed duel and a race of attrition.
The upcoming event will probably not be any different.

That domination appears to be happening again with Abebe Mekonnen, an Ethiopian policeman, winning the Boston Marathon.
Patience is a desired asset for marathoners.
Patience paid off for two winners of the Chicago Marathon on Sunday.
Heat, humidity, and strong winds, however, sapped the strength of the runners.
The two winners of the men's and women's divisions conserved their energy until the last few miles of the race.
Patience again paid off on Sunday for the running of the 26.2-mile Long Beach Marathon.
The two winners waited for other runners to make mistakes and for the sun to take its toll.

Lieutenant Zanti, USN, is a marathoner with determination.
When he had to cancel his plans to enter the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, he decided that he would run a marathon on his ship, the WISCONSIN.

Finally, for the marathon enthusiast, there are now "marathon vacations" for those runners who would like to run in a marathon and see a city at the same time.
