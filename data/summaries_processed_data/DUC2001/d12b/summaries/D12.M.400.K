Throughout the Reagan and Clinton administrations, the increasing costs of the huge welfare system worried the presidents, Congress and the public.
During Reagan's administration, both houses of Congress, the governors and the president devised plans for training and educating recipients that they might ultimately achieve independence.
The Wall Street Journal urged President Reagan to make a welfare reform plan his overriding goal, reminding him of public dissatisfaction over skyrocketing costs.
Reagan's Domestic Council Plan, they added, would give wide latitude to states' experiments; however, they feared Congress was not as anxious as the governors.
Reagan asked the states to submit individual plans for reform.
At the governors' meeting in 1987, the emerging consensus was to change welfare from an income-maintenance to a job-support system including a work requirement.
The drawback in such a plan was an added cost of two billion dollars, possibly worsening the deficit.
Late in 1987 as the House of Representatives prepared to debate the Family Welfare Reform Act, the Wall Street Journal questioned its merits, estimating that less than 25 percent of expenditures would be spent for reforms such as welfare-to-work programs which the Journal felt should be the focus of the Act.
By the fall of 1988, President Reagan threatened to veto any welfare bill not including a work requirement.
He added that despite a growing economy, those on welfare were being left behind, and again asked the states to come up with plans.
A House bill under consideration at the time provided for training and education, child and health care.
In 1993, President Clinton said he would name a task-force to reform welfare, to include job training, a work requirement and health and child care benefits.
He, too, urged the states to experiment with welfare reform.
The Financial Times wrote in August that welfare in America had become synonymous with urban problems and that Clinton's welfare reforms subliminally suggested a war on all those ills.
Government conservatives, meanwhile, suggested a welfare time-limit, while others, government job programs.
Internationally, members of the Organizations for Economic Cooperation and Development worried that budget deficits and debt ceilings were worsening as welfare costs soared, citing increasing longevity, higher pensions and soaring healthcare costs.
Some solutions suggested were later retirement, lower benefits and higher individual contributions.
In 1993, Wisconsin and Georgia got federal permission to reform welfare.
