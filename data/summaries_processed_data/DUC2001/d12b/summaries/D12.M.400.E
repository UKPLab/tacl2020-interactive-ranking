The welfare situation in the U.S. was in such disarray and so costly to the public during the Reagan and Clinton administrations that it became a priority for reform.
The core of the problem concerned the several million families caught up in poverty and dependency.
Huge sums (100 billion dollars per annum) were given to welfare with no improvement.
During their administrations, the two presidents worked with the governors to come up with solutions.
There was a surprising amount of agreement.
One Reagan point of disagreement, however, was on a minimum level of benefits.
He informed Congress at that time that he would veto any legislation that did not contain a work requirement.
Democrats favored a House-passed bill that would make welfare recipients who worked better off than those who did not work.
The requirement to work would be left to the state and local governments which administered the programs.
The House of Representatives during the Reagan administration was scheduled to vote on another 5.2 billion dollar welfare bill.
It was described as a welfare reform bill but in reality, it paid only lip service to reform.
Both parties in the House believed that welfare-to-work programs were valuable; however, the number of long-term welfare recipients increased.
Reformers insisted that valid reform shrink the number of welfare dependents and enhance the work ethic.
The pledge to "end welfare as we know it" and the two-year limitation on welfare checks were pre-election themes voiced by President Clinton.
Amid public pressure to reduce the welfare rolls, Clinton's reform efforts centered on expanded job training for the unemployed and the requirement that people work for a welfare check.
In an attempt to get some plan into operation, the federal government gave its approval to the states of Wisconsin and Georgia to implement their pilot programs.
The Wisconsin plan discontinued payments under the program Aid To Families Of Dependent Children after two years.
The Georgia plan reduced welfare payments to all able-bodied adults who refused to work and denied increases to families on long-term welfare who have more children.
The U.S. was not the only nation faced with welfare reform.
Capitalist economies in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were all faced with spiraling welfare costs.
One view held that OECD nations at some future point might only be able to afford caring for those unable to care for themselves.
