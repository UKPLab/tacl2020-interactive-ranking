President Reagan, believing that Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the government spends each year on unsuccessful anti- poverty programs, made welfare reform a priority for his administration.
He further believed that, given America's strong economy with low unemployment, any welfare reform program must contain a work requirement.
He vowed to veto any reform legislation that Congress passed that did not contain a work requirement, saying, "The best way to learn to work is to work."
A national consensus has been forming around welfare reform.
Fundamentally its goal should be: to shrink the welfare system, to eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work the focus of welfare reform.
Controversy occurs when legislators strive to determine how this goal should be accomplished.
Some conservatives believe that a strict time limit, say, two years, should be placed on the receipt of welfare.
Many people believe this is too drastic, preferring a phased in program whereby welfare recipients must do something to earn continued benefits, such as work, vocational training or continuing education.
Many states began experimental reform programs, some containing time limits, work or educational requirements.
Bill Clinton also campaigned on a platform of welfare reform pledging to "end welfare as we know it."
He, too, believes that welfare must be temporary help to the needy and not a way of life.
However, upon entering office, Clinton made it clear that welfare reform would have to come after two higher priority items: reducing the deficit and passing healthcare reform, both of which he believes would help alleviate welfare.
The Family Support Act of 1988 is a welfare bill that later became the focus of President Clinton's reform efforts.
This law is based on work done by the National Governors Association while co-chaired by Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas.
The Clinton administration was also flexible in granting individual states waivers from federal welfare requirements in order to experiment with various reform programs.
Several states had done so, quite successfully.
Welfare reform is not just an American problem.
The 24 member nations of the European "Organization for Economic Co-operation" have concluded that their rapidly growing welfare costs my soon become insupportable.
Demographics, specifically an increasingly aged population, is causing a significant increase in public pensions, the OEC's largest welfare cost item.
In a competitive global economy, no country can burden its businesses with higher welfare costs than its neighbors.
