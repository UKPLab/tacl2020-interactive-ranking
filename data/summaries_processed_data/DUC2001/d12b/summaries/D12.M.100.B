Welfare reform has received government emphasis from the Reagan administration through the Clinton administration.
Believing that huge welfare expenditures had been mostly unsuccessful, a consensus finally formed that welfare should be short-term help for the needy, not a way of life, and the goal of reform must be to place welfare recipients into the workforce.
This is being accomplished through successful federal and state programs that place time limits on receiving welfare and require recipients to earn benefits through work or study.
The 24 European member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation are also struggling with their welfare problems.
