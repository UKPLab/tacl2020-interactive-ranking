Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.
According to state Health Department statistics, the incidence of diabetes in the Hispanic population is three times that of the general population.
Health experts believe the Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors.
"Our food is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition," said Torres.
"But it's the way we prepare the food that messes things up for us.
"; In her classes, Torres said she will instruct her students to prepare tamales, refried beans and other traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than the more traditional recipes that call for the use of lard.
And instead of eating four tortillas at one sitting, she recommends they be eaten throughout the day.
Although courses for Hispanic diabetics and their families have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years, lessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease will be offered for the first time.
Sue Ann Kelly, education director for the Diabetes Society, said the classes may be the first ones ever geared specifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle.
"It's a powerful feeling our educators get when they discover all the cultural issues that come in to play when dealing with diabetes," she said.
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The next course for Hispanic diabetics and their families will be 9 a.m. to noon Saturday at Alexian Brother's Hospital, 225 N. Jackson Ave.
Registration will begin at 8:30 a.m.
Classes are free.

For those who can't make it to class, the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara County offers the bilingual booklet, "Comer Bien Para Vivir Mejor," a seven-day Mexican food menu for diabetics as well as those who want to eat healthy.
