Twelve million Americans have diabetes, but the incidence is highest in minorities - Native Americans, Hispanics and blacks.
Hispanics are three times more likely to develop diabetes as the general population; that is, 14-21% of Hispanics, and up to 40% of those in the 64 to 75 year age range may develop the disease.
Adult Onset, or Type II diabetes, is the most common type found in this group.
This is especially devastating in those parts of the country that are heavily populated with these ethnic groups.
San Antonio, Texas, where the population is 50% Hispanic, often of Mexican origin, the University of Texas Health Center has become a center of diabetes investigation, attracting a prestigious group of investigators from Yale University to relocate there.
Their hope is to locate a gene predisposing to the disease, and develop a screening test for potential victims.
Dr. Ralph DeFronzo, who heads the group, has sent teams out to the neighborhoods to study the local population, test for the disease, and teach methods of control and prevention.
His researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diet, frequently dominated by cheap processed and fried foods, their lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention are the root causes of their predisposition.
They are also reaching out to educate children, a step they believe is critical.
California, with its high Latino population, is also active in the struggle, led by health professionals and the Diabetes Society.
Their program focuses on prevention of obesity, a key predisposing factor, along with strong heredity tendencies.
Clients are taught to modify their diet, especially food preparation - frying with unsaturated fats, for example, spacing of meals throughout the day and increasing exercise.
The Society also teaches about symptoms, treatment and complications of diabetes.
They are learning that cultural factors are highly important in combating the disease.
Meanwhile, researchers have reported to the International Diabetes Foundation that they have found a hormone which may lead to new treatments for Type II diabetes.
Amylin, found in high levels in the diabetic pancreas, may be responsible for the obesity and lower insulin secretion and effectiveness found in these patients.
Currently, obesity is thought of as a cause, not an effect, of the disease.
Researchers hope to learn how to block amylin's actions.
Symptoms of diabetes include excessive urination, thirst and hunger with an accompanying weight loss.
Complications include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene of the extremities.
