In 1989, it was reported that twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes; more than 150,000 Americans died from diabetes each year; another 150,000 deaths were diabetes related; and Hispanics were three times as likely to develop diabetes than the general population.
Accordingly, diabetes afflicted one in eight Hispanic adults, a rate higher than that of any ethnic group except American Indians.
Diabetes is a defect in the body's system for using sugar in the blood.
It results from the body's failure to make insulin.
In 1988, a study began of a newly isolated hormone, dubbed "amylin", found in the pancreases of diabetics that was expected to lead to new treatments for Type II diabetes, the most common form of the disease.
Amylin may be responsible for obesity, reduced insulin secretion, and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes.
Complications include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene.
Researchers hoped to develop substances that block amylin's secretion.
Some researchers believed that Hispanics held the key to what sparks diabetes.
San Antonio, 50 percent Hispanic in population, became a base for diabetes studies.
The most common form was found to develop mostly in obese adults over forty with a family history of the disease.
Researchers felt that poor Hispanics' diet of cheap processed, high-calorie foods, lack of exercise, and infrequent medical attention increased their risk of acquiring diabetes.
Researchers started testing an anti-diabetic drug used successfully outside the US, called metaforim, which was expected to have FDA approval.
Moreover, there was confidence that Hispanics would respond to educational efforts on the disease.
Examples of how educational programs could work were the indications that Americans' risk of heart disease was lowering.
In San Jose, California, a free hospital clinic and neighborhood programs were set up for Hispanics to learn how to manage illness.
The focus was on three ways to manage diabetes: diet, exercise and medication.
Participants would learn that traditional dishes could be just as tasty, but healthier, when made with unsaturated fats and that exercise could reduce weight, which in turn would lower the risk of contacting diabetes.
Similarly, health professionals of a Santa Clara Valley Hispanic Program began nutrition and exercise classes in an effort to educate Hispanics on the dangers of diabetes.
Students would be given instructions, geared to Hispanic lifestyle, on cooking with polyunsaturated oil instead of lard and on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise.
