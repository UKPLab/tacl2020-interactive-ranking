Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds, increase in March and are most common in May and June between 3 and 6pm.
They occur most often in parts of large thunderstorms adjacent to hail.
Tornado deaths are decreasing with greater public awareness and better warning.
A tornado watch means conditions are suitable for tornado development.
A warning means one has developed.
In case of a tornado, go underground or to a central part of a building, present a low profile and cover your head.
If in a car or mobile home, leave it for a safe shelter or low area.
