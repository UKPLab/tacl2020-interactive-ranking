Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds, usually occur as winter transitions to spring.
They increase in March and are most common in May and June.
They usually occur between 3 and 6pm and are least likely just before sunrise but can occur any month and any time.
Typically tornadoes are 50 yards wide, head northeast at 30 mph, and travel two miles on the ground.
Single large thunderstorms are likelier tornado-producers than groups of storms competing to rotate.
Most strong tornadoes are actually 6-7 small ones rotating around a larger tornado's center.
Tornadoes occur most often in thunderstorm portions adjacent to large hail.
Tornadoes are impossible to redirect or squelch.
Less than 2% are violent.
The Fujita Scale ranks tornado strength from zero (weak) to five (violent).
Tornado deaths are decreasing with greater public awareness and better warning, aided by computers accessing many data sources.
A tornado watch means conditions are suitable for tornado development.
A warning means one has developed.
In case of a tornado, people should go underground or to a central part of a building, present low profiles and cover their heads.
If in a car or mobile home, they should leave it for a safe shelter or low area.
