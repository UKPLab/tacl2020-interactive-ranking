According to media reports of 1988-91, National Weather Service records and other sources have indicated that most tornadoes occur between noon and 6 P.M.
They also travel from southwest to northeast.
A thunderstorm next to large hail is often the spawning area where tornadoes begin.
The arrival of spring in Texas and the U.S. heartland often brings with it the tornado season.
May is the peak month for tornadoes.
To keep loss of life and property damage to a minimum, the National Weather Service advises people to be familiar with a safety plan before a tornado strikes.
On 19 April 1988, the residents of Madison, Florida experienced the fury of a tornado that cut a 12-mile swath through the middle of this town of 3500 people.
Mobile homes took the brunt of the tornado's fury.
Other adjacent counties in Florida and the neighboring state of Georgia were also hit by hail, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes.
Once again, a number of mobile homes were destroyed or damaged.
Although the most dangerous period for tornadoes is in the spring, they can also occur at other times of the year.
On 15 and 16 November, 1988, for example, a series of tornadoes and thunderstorms with high winds struck the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Southeast area states.
Seventeen died and 514 were injured.
Damage was in the millions.
Flooding also occurred in some of these areas.
One city, Huntsville, Alabama, took the major portion of the casualties with 17 killed, 463 injured and 1000 homeless.
Tornado watches for the two days of 15 and 16 November reached as far north as the Northeast.
The year 1990 was particularly notable for its disastrous tornadoes and floods in the Midwest and Southeast.
An above-average 726 tornadoes touched down.
Flooding in the South and Plains added to the loss of life and property damage.
One plus factor was the use of computers for the watch, warning and response system which kept the death and injury total low.
In 1990, Tetsuya Fujita was a science professor at the University of Chicago.
He was one of the world's authorities on tornadoes.
He helped to define the conditions that develop tornadoes and originated a scale for tornado measurement.
He was instrumental in deploying doppler radar at airports so that strong air currents could be detected and air crashes avoided.
