Most tornadoes occur according to a pattern of locations and times.
Texas and the U.S. heartland are the prime locations for tornado occurrence and noon to 6 P.M. is the most common time.
Tornadoes, on fewer occasions, have ranged beyond these parameters.
Experts have developed equipment to improve detection and warning.
