It was no surprise that Yugoslav federal military commanders met on March 25, 1988 to consider ways to quell dissent in Slovenia and concluded that "dissident tendencies" in Slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist government.
Slovenian Communists had frequently criticized the way the federal government dealt with the country's economic and social problems and some army commanders had complained that Slovenia's leadership had failed to act firmly against political dissidents.
But at the time of the March meeting the military commanders did not discuss any plan of action against Slovenia.
Although liberal, prosperous and tiny Slovenia and the hard-line communist leadership of giant Serbia had been fighting for years, matters came to a head in December 1989 when Serbia banned all political and economic contacts with Slovenia.
At issue were Slovenia's demand for regional autonomy within a loose confederation and its scheduling of multi-party elections.
Serbia insisted on a centralized federation with a single Communist Party.
In June 1990 a coalition of center-right parties formed a new Slovenian government and in July parliament declared the republic's full sovereignty, but stopped short of calling for secession.
The hard-line Communist government in Serbia vehemently opposed the idea of a confederation as well as western-style democracy.
The stand-off continued until June of 1991 when, after months of unsuccessful negotiations among leaders of the six republics, Slovenia and Croatia seceded from the Yugoslav federation.
Federal forces were quickly mobilized and moved against Croat and Slovene police and militia.
Slovenia negotiated a peace agreement, but fighting in neighboring Croatia continued.
Independent Slovenia faced major economic problems.
Large foreign exchange deposits were frozen in the former National Bank of Yugoslavia.
Slovene enterprises had always relied on sales in Yugoslavia and cheap Serbian raw materials to support exports to the rest of Europe.
Severance of relations with Serbia and warfare in Croatia had reduced Slovene exports to Yugoslavia by 85%.
Although there were signs of a softening of the antagonism between Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by 1994 no one was predicting a normalization of relations.
Although the outcome was not clear, the Slovenian Republic persevered in its efforts to promote trade with the rest of Europe and development into a full-fledged market-oriented, multi-party parliamentary democracy with hopes of joining the European Community, the World Bank, and the international Monetary Fund.
