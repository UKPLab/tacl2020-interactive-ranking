Despite worsening relations with the federal government of Yugoslavia and its dominant republic, Serbia, the communist republic of Slovenia continued to push for sovereignty within a looser confederation of sovereign states and in the spring of 1990 held the first free elections in Yugoslavia in 45 years.
The resulting non-Communist government declared Slovenia's full sovereignty and after months of unsuccessful negotiation with the other five republics formally seceded from the federation in June of 1991.
After a short occupation by federal troops the Slovenian government negotiated a peace agreement and proceeded with its business of economic recovery as a market-oriented, multi-party parliamentary democracy.
