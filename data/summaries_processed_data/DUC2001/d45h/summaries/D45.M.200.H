After Slovenia arrested pro-Serbian demonstrators in December 1989, Serbia severed political and economic contact.
In June 1990 a new government in Slovenia approved a plan for Slovenian sovereignty within a Yugoslav confederation.
Croatia took similar action.
Fighting erupted after Serbian president Milosevic delayed the 1991 installation of a Croatian federal president and both Slovenia and federal forces prepared for further hostilities.
In mid-June an EC-brokered cease-fire called for installation of the president and a three-month delay in independence moves.
More fighting followed Slovenia's and Croatia's June 25, 1991 secession from Yugoslavia.
Problems facing Slovenia's efforts to become a market-oriented democracy included funds still frozen by Yugoslavia in March 1992 and the need to establish new foreign credit and gain admission to the IMF and World Bank.

Slovenia sought new markets to replace those lost in Yugoslavia.
By March 1993 privatization had begun, wages had dropped and productivity rose as Slovenia worked to stay competitive without cheap Serbian raw materials.
