In 1988 the Republic of Slovenia was a small one-party communist state within a federation of communist states dominated by Serbia.
By 1994 Slovenia was an independent market-oriented, multi-party parliamentary democracy.
The transition was not easy and the tiny nation was not without problems, but the accomplishment was remarkable.
Even before 1988 the Communist government of Slovenia was not afraid to criticize the way the authoritarian federal government dealt with the country's economic and social problems.
Serbia's intolerance of Slovenia's relatively liberal outlook came to a head in December 1989 when Serbia banned all political and economic contacts with Slovenia.
Uncowed, Slovenia in the spring of 1990 went on with scheduled multi-party elections which resulted in a new government led by a coalition of center-right parties that called for full sovereignty within a loose confederation.
Negotiations among the six republics failed and in June 1991 Slovenia seceded from the Yugoslav federation.
Federal military intervention followed, but tiny Slovenia was able to negotiate a peace agreement and emerged with full independence but serious economic problems caused by the severance of relations with Serbia and continuing warfare elsewhere in Yugoslavia.
By 1994 these problems remained but Slovenia worked diligently to develop markets in the rest of Europe.
