The programs of the World Bank have yet to meet with success in reducing the Third World debt.
There are a number of ideas on how this should be accomplished.
One is to invest in the private sector and bypass the governments of developing countries.
Another is to lend new money only and not reduce any debt.
Yet another is to write-off Third World debt as uncollectible.
A persistent problem in the loaning of money by the World Bank to Third World governments is that they are often swamped by interest payments.
Brazil, the largest debtor nation, blames the industrialized countries for its poverty problems.

Some believe that the bank's policies are correct and that poverty in the Third World is caused by their own governments.
Recent individual efforts to alleviate Third World poverty and debt may be successful.
"Village banking" is a means of investment using loans to poor women at low interest rates to finance their private enterprise.
