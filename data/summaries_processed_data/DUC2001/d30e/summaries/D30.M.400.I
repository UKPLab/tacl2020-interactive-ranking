From 1987 to 1993 poverty prevailed throughout most of the Third World as the debts of Third World nations grew.
In 1988, the Foreign Minister of Brazil declared that hunger was endemic in Asia, Africa, and much of the Americas.
In 1991 one billion people were living on less than $1 a day.
By 1993 there was some progress in Asia, with the percentage living in absolute poverty dropping to 10%, but in Africa this ratio rose to 50%.
The Third World debt in 1987 was $1.19 trillion and in 1991 it was $1.341 trillion.
In 1984, Third World nations began to pay annually more in debt service fees than they received in loans.
By 1989 the debt service costs were $50.1 billion.
This massive debt and many nations' inability to pay, created in 1987 two U.S. banking groups--smaller, regional institutions that could write off loans or place them on a non-accrual basis and large, major banks with thin reserves that could not afford to do that.
Developed nations were asked to cancel or reschedule debts and increase financial aid.
In 1988, industrial nations spent an average of 0.34% of their GNP on helping developing nations.
Some, including Lord Bauer of Britain, blamed poverty on the poor nations and decried allowing loan defaults.
The World Bank was expected to lead in solving these problems.
In the late 1980's the bank president supported a traditional bank role as a development--not financial--institution, loaning to countries pursuing economic reforms, maintaining statistics and issuing reports, and rarely intervening in national crisis.
In 1990 the bank began to move toward emphasizing programs that eased poverty and helped the environment, but in 1991 critics still recommended moving from structural adjustment loans and not forgiving debts to emphasis on infrastructure investment and direct poverty relief.
The new bank president directed the staff, in 1991, to link loan volume to a country's efforts to fight poverty.
More money would go to those governments with stronger commitment to reducing poverty.
In 1993, he noted there had been some progress.
In 1982, 5% of loans had a poverty focus, while in 1992 almost 50% did.
Micro-enterprise lending (or village banking) began to boom in the period.
Foundations, with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development, were giving very small loans to villagers for grassroots enterprises, exporting free-market economics, and fueling growth.
Repayment of these loans exceeded 90%.
