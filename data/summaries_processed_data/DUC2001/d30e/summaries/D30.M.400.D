Poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world.
One billion people live on less than one dollar a day.
More than 110 million Third World children lack access even to primary education.
Extreme poverty is further complicated by horrific inequality.
In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10 percent is 20 years less than for the richest 10 percent.
In 1992, World Bank president Lewis Preston issued a directive to link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty.
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990's.
At the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly in 1988, Third World countries led by Brazil blamed industrialized nations in part for perpetuating their poverty.
A similar theme sounded in West Berlin, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded "more forceful action" to help Third World countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts.
In 1990, Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the United States and other creditors than they received in new loans "a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies" the World Bank Reported.
The net cash drain from the debtor countries to the richer ones began in 1984.
Until then, the richer countries had provided more in new loans to Third World nation than those countries paid back.
Lord Bauer, House of Lords, Westminster SWI expressed concern that the international community may be encouraging Third World countries to default on loans by canceling or rescheduling debts "frequently several times for the same country."
Others feel that there are different ways to alleviate poverty and large debt.
In September 1991, John Hatch, founder of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance developed a concept of using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise.
The loans will allow them to create savings while paying interest of 1 percent to 3 percent and qualifying for bigger loans.
Using the Hatch concept, U.S. development organizations are finding that some of the world's poorest entrepreneurs repay their debts at rates approaching 100%.
Tiny Third World businesses commonly repay "microloans" faithfully because they crave the security of a favorable credit rating.
The money helps them start or expand their businesses and boosts their local economies.
