Here is a chronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, its cleanup and related developments: March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh Reef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
March 26: Alaska fishermen's union spokeswoman Riki Ott says the group wants full compensation for damage from the spill.
More than 250 lawsuits will be filed against Exxon in the following months.
March 30: Exxon fires tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood after tests reveal he was legally drunk 10 hours after the accident.
April 4: U.S.

June 19: Exxon and other big oil companies announce plans for a voluntary network of response teams capable of handling big spills anywhere in U.S. coastal waters.
Estimated cost: $250 million.
Sept. 15: Exxon suspends its beach cleanup for the winter, claiming it has left 1,100 miles of oiled beaches ``environmentally stable'' and saying its 25-week cleanup involving more than 10,000 workers was a job well done.
Alaska officials disagree and announce their own $21 million winter cleanup plan.
Oct. 10: State officials warn people not to consume shellfish in areas affected by oil.
Oct. 27: The National Wildlife Federation says Exxon has resigned from its corporate advisory board.
Exxon calls the conservation group unfair in its criticism of the oil spill; the group calls Exxon ``a corporate pariah.''
