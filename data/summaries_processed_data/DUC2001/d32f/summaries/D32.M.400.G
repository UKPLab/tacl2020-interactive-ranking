On 24 March 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef about 25 miles from Valdez, Alaska, spilling over 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into the calm waters of Prince William Sound.
The Exxon Company said the captain was not on the bridge when the accident occurred.
The third mate in command did not have a proper pilot's license.
The captain, third mate, and a helmsman were relieved of duty and subpoenaed by the National Transportation Safety Board.
Local residents and environmentalists complained about the slow pace of cleanup, namely because of the size of the spill and the fact that it was in such a productive area.
Within two days, the oil spread out over 100 miles and the toll on wildlife began mounting.
The Coast Guard said the chemical agents used to disperse and sink crude oil failed because they depend on rough seas to break up the oil.
A multi-million dollar lawsuit was filed against Exxon charging that the spill had led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a gallon.
Meanwhile, Exxon had paid out $500,000 to fishermen on claims of lost work and were processing 300 more.
The Alaska State Senate passed several bills aimed at protection from another devastating spill.
In early May, Exxon officials released a revised plan for cleaning 364 miles of Alaskan coastline.
The Coast Guard said the plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics but did not reject it.
Consumer activists blasted Exxon for lack of preparation and called for a boycott of the company.
In June, Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the tanker and began preparations for permanent repairs.
In July, Alaska's governor threatened to close down the Trans-Alaska pipeline unless owners met terms for improved safety measures.
In mid-September, Exxon suspended its beach cleanup for winter.
Alaskan officials disagreed it was a job well done.
In November, the US House of Representatives passed a bill preserving states' ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability laws than the federal government.
By early 1990, the worst was over but Exxon's total cleanup costs were $1.38 billion, only 5 to 9 percent of spilled oil was recovered, and thousands of animals had died.
In February, a federal grand jury indicted Exxon on five criminal counts.
In March, a jury found the Valdez skipper guilty of negligent discharge of oil but innocent of more serious charges.
