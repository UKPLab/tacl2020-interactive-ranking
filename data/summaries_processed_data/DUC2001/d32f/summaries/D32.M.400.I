The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker carrying 1.2 billion barrels of crude oil from the marine terminal at Valdez, Alaska, ran aground in Prince William Sound at 12:30 am (Alaskan time) on March 24, 1989.
It eventually spilled 11.3 million gallons of crude oil.
On March 24, the Baton Rouge was moved in to start off-loading the remaining oil and the governor of Alaska arrived to inspect the damage.
On March 25, the slick was 7 miles long, divers had discovered 6-8 holes in the Valdez' hull, and a Coast Guard strike-team had arrived.
By March 26, National Transportation Safety Board investigators had arrived, the slick covered 100 square miles, Alaska's governor declared the sound a disaster area, and a bird rescue center was set up.
Exxon fired the captain of the Valdez on March 30.
By April 3, the herring-fishing season was cancelled for the year and gasoline prices began to rise in California.
On April 4, the Baton Rouge completed the transfer of 42 million gallons of crude that had remained on the Valdez.
The Valdez was refloated the next day and moved to an isolated island for emergency repairs.
The flow of oil in the trans-Alaskan pipeline, which had been reduced on March 24, returned to normal.
The slick now covered an area the size of Delaware.
The oil reached the Kenai Fjords National Park by April 6 and Katmai National Park, some 500 miles away, by May 1.
On May 1, Exxon released its clean-up plan, which was reviewed by a Coast Guard official and found to be lacking in specifics.
A boycott of Exxon was kicked off on April 2 with several rallies.
State and federal officials began asking for investigations of rapidly rising gasoline prices.
Exxon ceased its clean-up operations on September 15.
An October survey still showed 117 miles of beach moderately or heavily oiled.
In January 1990, Exxon announced that it had spent $1.38 billion because of the spill and expected to spend $500 million more.
Its 1989 net earnings were down $1.46 billion from 1988.
On February 27 a grand jury indicted Exxon companies on criminal charges.
In March, the U.S. Wildlife Service predicted it could take 75 years to restore some of the seabird colonies and the ship's captain was found guilty of negligent discharge of oil.
Exxon was ordered to resume the cleanup on May 1.
