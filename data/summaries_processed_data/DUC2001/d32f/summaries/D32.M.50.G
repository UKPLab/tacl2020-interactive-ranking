In March 1989, an Exxon oil tanker crashed on a reef near Valdez, Alaska, spilling 8.4 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound seriously damaging the environment.
The cleanup was slow and Exxon was subject to severe compensation costs and indictment by a federal jury on five criminal charges.
