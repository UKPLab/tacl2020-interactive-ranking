In late August 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit the Florida coast south of Miami with winds up to 165 mph, causing at least fifteen deaths, severe property damage and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity.
In Dade County alone 250,000 were left homeless.
The town of Homestead and its nearby air force base were leveled.
As the storm continued across the Gulf of Mexico it was feared that it might hit New Orleans, but fortunately it made landfall in a relatively lightly populated area of Louisiana and quickly lost force as it moved over land.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency which was charged with handling such disasters had become a Republican patronage reserve and proved completely incapable of doing its job.
After frustrating delays in providing any effective relief, two of President Bush's assistants, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card and Chief of Staff James Baker, stepped in to do the job.
The president dispatched troops to Florida and gave a nationwide television address from the Oval Office promising to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base and committing the government to paying relief costs.
The insurance costs of Andrew alone were about $8 billion making it the most expensive disaster to have hit the US up to that time.
