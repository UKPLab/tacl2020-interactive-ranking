Hurricane Andrew slammed across southern Florida and then continued into Louisiana where damage was limited because the storm narrowly missed low-lying New Orleans and the major oil industry complexes along the coast and offshore.
In Florida, wind gusts up to 165 mph left a ten-mile wide swath of death and destruction about 25 miles south of Miami.
The town of Homestead, including a local air force base, was largely flattened.
Total storm damage may exceed $20 billion, most of it not insured.
US property-casualty insurers expect to pay an estimated $7.3 billion in Florida alone.
This year, counting $3.9 billion for the LA riots and a series of tornadoes, plus Florida's Hurricane losses, the industry total rises to $11.2 billion.
This far exceeds the record $7.6 billion paid in 1989 for Hurricane Hugo and California's Loma Prieta earthquake.
Because US property- casualty insurers recently have purchased less foreign reinsurance for catastrophes, they alone will incur most of Andrew's losses.
Authorities believe they have adequate funds to cover the disaster.
After a poor initial response, President Bush seems finally to be getting disaster aid to those in need.
He has pledged to rebuild Homestead AFB and has sent the military to Florida.
