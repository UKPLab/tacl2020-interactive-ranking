The nation's police forces were plagued in the late 1980s and early 1990s by racism, brutality, intimidation and false arrest.
The conduct of one of these police forces, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), was anything but exemplary.
Typical of one if its operations gone awry was an incident at Los Angeles Airport.
A policeman falsely arrested Joe Morgan, a retired major league infielder, for drug trafficking because he was black.
The beating of Rodney King on videotape prompted a number of investigations of the LAPD.
These investigations concluded that the LAPD was riddled with racism and brutality and called for the resignation of its chief, Daryl Gates.
He agreed to step down in 1992.
In 1990-91 the LAPD, as well as the forces in 49 other U.S. cities, were confronted with a new dilemma: how to handle non-violent, anti-abortion demonstrators.
The LAPD decided to apply "pain compliance" techniques, twisting arms, etc., in getting protesters to comply.
The situation became so serious by 1991 that the Chief of Police in San Jose felt compelled to speak out about a code of silence among other police chiefs.
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was successful in maintaining a low profile--until his own officers became involved in four shootings and committed robbery.
The Long Beach Police force was also having its problems.
A white policeman pushed a black man through a plate glass window after a traffic stop.
The incident was videotaped in a sting operation set up by the black man, an undercover police sergeant.
Other police forces had the same problems.
In Chicago, blacks charged the police with brutality, intimidation, beatings and false arrest.
The Minneapolis Police force was charged with racism and brutality in the deaths of two blacks.
In Kansas City, Missouri, the charges were excessive force and racism.
One incident involved a black priest who was attacked by police while on the ground.
A Santa Clara attorney described a case of police brutality involving a high speed chase.
When apprehended, the suspect was mauled by police.
When the brutality was covered up by police, four witnesses came forward and the policeman was prosecuted.
In a twist of irony, the Ventura County district attorney's office refused to prosecute suspects arrested by police who claimed police brutality and filed charges.
Reasons for dismissal included a "lack of evidence."
Police brutality circumvented the justice system in these instances.
