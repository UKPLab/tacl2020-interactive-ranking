De Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa controls 80% of the world's uncut diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization.
The cartel has sales agreements with mines and offers diamonds to select dealers.
De Beers was formed in 1888 by Cecil Rhodes and has been controlled since 1929 by the Oppenheimer family.
De Beers has kept the diamond market stable by controlling supply.
It has bought up diamonds that flooded the market, discouraged banks from lending to diamond speculators, dumped diamonds to force producers into sales agreements, imposed quotas on producers when sales were declining, and revived the industry by putting big money into promotion.
De Beers has maintained its own production by opening a new mine and extending the life of two others through underground mining.
Innovations have included automated processing and bussing workers in daily from their homes.
Desire for greater control of their countries' wealth has caused African nations to demand better terms.
In 1990 De Beers moved half its interests to Switzerland.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, unofficial diamond exports were rumored and De Beers signed a new sales agreement with the republic of Yukutia.
The US remains the largest diamond market, followed by Japan.
