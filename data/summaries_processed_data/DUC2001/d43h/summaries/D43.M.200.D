Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving.
De Beers's Central Selling Organization is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York.
Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers's future may not be stable.
In London, the Office of Trading is investigating the anti-competitive practices of De Beers.
Complaints suggest the De Beers have a monopoly on diamond trading in London.
In Botswana some politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract so that part of their country's output can be sold independently.
In Angola, more than $1 million worth of diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
While De Beers have been faced with some uncertainly over the control of the uncut diamond market, other ventures are giving them more power.
The new Venetia mine more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tons of ore to recover 4.96m carats.
The mine has revitalized De Beers' production and accounts for half the output in South Africa and replaces production from its 100-year-old Kimberley mines.
