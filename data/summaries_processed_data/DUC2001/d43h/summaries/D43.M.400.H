De Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa is the sole middleman in a diamond cartel known as the Syndicate, which controls 80% of the world's uncut diamond market.
The cartel is a pipeline between mines in various countries and international diamond cutting centers.
Its London-based Central Selling Organization offers diamond assortments at 10 "sights" a year to a select group of 160 dealers.
De Beers was formed in 1888 by British colonialist Cecil Rhodes and has been controlled since 1929 by South Africa's Oppenheimer family.
Its rise began in 1938 when Harry Oppenheimer began urging couples to buy diamond engagement rings.
A brief 1989 investigation of De Beers' alleged anti-competitive practices was dropped, but De Beers has aggressively, ruthlessly and effectively kept the diamond market stable by controlling supply.
When recession in the early 1980s forced diamond speculators to dump diamonds, De Beers educated banks to discourage them from lending to diamond speculators.
When Zaire left the cartel in 1981 De Beer dumped diamonds to force it back in.
In the late 1980s, it revived the industry by putting millions of dollars into promotion, withholding stocks, and imposing large price increases.
When illegal mining began in Angola, De Beers bought up smuggled-out diamonds.
It imposed quotas on producers in 1994 after sales declined because of slowing economies, high interest rates and a market flooded with illegal diamonds.
De Beers has maintained its own production, although its 100-year old Kimberley mines began running out, by opening the Venetia mine in 1992 and by planning to extend the life of its Finsch mine and the Jwaneng mine, co-owned with Botswana, through underground mining whenever open-pit maximum productive depth was reached.
Recent mining innovations have included reducing employees through automated processing and fewer overseers, and replacing migrant workers with those bussed in from their homes for daily shifts.
Desire for greater control over their wealth eventually caused several black majority African nations to demand a share of ownership or negotiate the right to partially sell independently.
To limit risk, in 1990 De Beers moved half its interests to Switzerland.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, De Beers signed a new sales agreement with the autonomous republic of Yukutia, where most Soviet diamonds are mined, although the former USSR's reorganization of its diamond industry remained unsettled.
Unofficial Russian diamond exports have long been rumored.
The US remains the largest diamond market, followed by Japan.
