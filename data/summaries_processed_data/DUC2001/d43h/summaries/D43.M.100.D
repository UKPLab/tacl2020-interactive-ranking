Despite predictions four years ago of the demise of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, the cartel is thriving.
De Beers's Central Selling Organization is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York.
However, in Botswana some politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract so that part of their country's output can be sold independently.
And in Angola, more than $1 million worth of diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
