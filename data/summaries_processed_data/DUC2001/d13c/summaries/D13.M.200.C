Clarence Thomas was born in rural Georgia.
From the age of seven until he left for college he lived with his maternal grandparents in Savannah.
His grandfather taught him perseverance, discipline and the necessity of hard work, values that have helped him succeed in a hostile environment.
At Holy Cross College he was a vocal champion of liberal causes for the first and only time in his life.
He graduated in 1971 and entered Yale Law School.
By the time he received his law degree in 1974, he had renounced liberalism as contrary to all his grandparents taught him.
His work carried him through positions with a private firm, and in federal and state governments.
He was appointed as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a position he held for eight years and that marked him as an opponent of quotas and affirmative action.
Thomas had become a favorite in the Republican Party.
In 1990 President Bush named him to be a federal appellate judge.
He was confirmed but there was considerable opposition.
A year later Bush nominated him to succeed Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.
After contentious hearings the Senate confirmed him and he is now an Associate Supreme Court Judge.
