Clarence Thomas was born in a rural area of Georgia on June 23, 1948.
His father deserted the family when Clarence was seven years old, and he was taken in by his maternal grandparents.
He has frequently said that his grandfather had an overpowering effect on his development, and credit for any success that he had achieved was owed to his hard-working grandparents.
Each year they scraped together to keep him in a Catholic school where they hoped the nuns would instill values and discipline.
His grandparents taught him perseverance, the value of hard work, and the need to rely on himself to succeed in a hostile environment.
Thomas graduated from Holy Cross College in 1971.
He participated in campus protests and championed liberal causes while in college.
He still held these views when he entered Yale Law School.
But by the time he graduated in 1974, he had renounced them as contrary to all that had been ingrained in him by his grandparents.
John Danforth, then Attorney for Missouri, recruited Thomas to serve as an assistant.
Thomas was an attorney for the Monsanto Company from 1977 to 1979.
Danforth, by then a senator, employed him as a legislative assistant until 1981.
With the coming of the Reagan administration, Thomas was made Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights, and a year later he became the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
It was in this position that his opposition to quotas and affirmative action drew attention and criticism from liberals.
A black conservative, Thomas was a favorite of republicans.
In 1990 President Bush appointed him to a judgeship on the United States Circuit Court.
The Senate confirmed him in a voice vote, but the outspoken opposition to his appointment was a harbinger of the struggle to come when Bush later named him to succeed Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.
Supporters called him a man of humble beginnings who rose to prominence on his own.
Critics said that he was helped along by government aid that he would now deny to others.
Senate confirmation in October 1991 made him an Associate Supreme Court Judge.
Thomas is married to Virginia Thomas and has a son by an earlier marriage.
