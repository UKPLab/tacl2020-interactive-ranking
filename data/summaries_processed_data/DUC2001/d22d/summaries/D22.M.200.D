In 1988 and 1989 forest fires burned out of control throughout the United States.
One of the largest fires charred more than 2.1 million acres in Alaska.
Another three blazes burned more than 208,000 acres in Montana.
Others states hit hard by forest fires included California, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Kentucky, Idaho, Arizona, Georgia and New Mexico.
Many of the fires were started as a result of lightening.
Fireworks set off in celebration of Independence Day caused others.
Humans started other fires, some by accident and some intentionally.
Following the 1988-forest fire season, a panel studying the government's "let it burn" policy recommended a temporary halt to the policy.
The recommendation came after the worst fire season ever in Yellowstone National Park.
The review team was asked to look at policies throughout the national parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.
The report said no fires should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened.
Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
But they also said, "in some cases, the social and economic effects" of allowing a forest fire to burn "may be unacceptable."
