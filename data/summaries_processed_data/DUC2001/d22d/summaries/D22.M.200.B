Each year, primarily in western States, tens of thousands of fires will burn hundreds of thousands of acres in national parklands and forests.
Although lightening starts most of them, many are caused by human carelessness; arsonists also start a significant number.
The Forest Service employees 125 criminal investigators whose job is to investigate arson and other crimes on federal lands.
The National Park Service follows a "natural burn" policy, which allows lightening- induced fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings.
In 1988, a panel recommended that this policy be halted until the Forest Service and the National Park Service improve and coordinate their fire management plans.
Also questioned is what our practice should be following a major fire.
Some believe that a hands-off "natural" reforestation policy is best.
Others believe that human intervention by seeding and planting trees helps the forest recover much faster.
Major fires are expensive.
In July 1989, the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on fire lines, along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10 helicopters.
Furthermore, the millions of dollars in destroyed vehicles, homes and structures, not to mention lost timber often exceed these firefighting costs.
