Jamaican-born Ben Johnson, 26, won a gold medal for Canada at the 1988 Olympics for his record 9.79-second 100-meter dash.
He forfeited the medal and all records and was suspended from competition when tests showed his steroid use.
Johnson later admitted steroid use since 1981 when a teammate and coach confirmed it.
