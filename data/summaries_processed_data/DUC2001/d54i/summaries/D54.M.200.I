In the early 1990's there was a strong move to enact term limitations on elected officials, especially legislators.
Several states were voting on limitations and some factions wanted national action restricting Congressional terms.
Polls revealed 75% of all Americans backed term limits.
Those supporting term limitations believed too much power had moved to the legislative branch from the executive branch.
Political careerism was decried.
The inability to unseat an incumbent was blamed on franking privileges and campaign finance laws.
With term limits, some expected candidates to become more dependent on the party for financial assistance and less dependent on special interest groups.
Term limitations were portrayed as constitutional.
Opponents of term limits believed they were illogical, wrong, an insult to voters and not supported by the nation's founders.
More inexperienced legislators would only increase the power of special interest groups, the unelected Congressional staffers, and Executive branch bureaucrats.
Terms limits would throw the good performers out with the bad.
The term limit opponents who agreed that the public was growing dissatisfied with the electoral process suggested an end to some of the legislative perquisites and overhauls of the committee and seniority systems.
