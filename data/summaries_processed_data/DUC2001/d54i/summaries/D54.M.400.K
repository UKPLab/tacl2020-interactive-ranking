During the early 1990s arguments raged across the country for and against term limits for members of some state legislatures and Congress.
Several states, including California, Washington and Colorado, took the issue to referendum.
A feeling of public disgust toward Congress and government emerged, crossing party lines.
Disenchanted voters felt they weren't being heard.
Their dissatisfaction had to do with inaction: they wanted movement on healthcare, taxes and jobs and they wanted some congressional perquisites eliminated.
A 1990 Gallup-CBS poll showed Americans wanted term limits by a large majority, crossing lines of race, gender, party, ideology and income.
Advocates for term limits cited the following arguments: 1.
Legislature would be less influenced by special interests; the people would have more control.
2.
Long-term incumbents develop arrogance, lack of accountability and a dearth of new ideas.
3.
A citizen Congress would provide better government.
4.
Many incumbents run unopposed.
5.
Term limits would open up politics to blacks, women and other minorities.
6.
Members of Congress spent too much time fund-raising and worrying about staying in office.
7.
Incumbents have a huge advantage: access to funds, media, travel and mail privileges.
8.
A citizen Congress would provide better government.
Those against term limits listed the following reasons: 1.

4.

6.
Good legislators would disappear with the bad.
7.
Term limits would prevent voters from voting for those they favor.
8.
Groups and interests want limits to improve their favorites' chances.

Amateurs would run (California) a huge, diverse state.
10.

T. J. Withal, Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, wrote in opposition to term limits that the Constitutional Convention rejected term limits as did the first Congress.
He also remembered that term limits would have unseated Henry Clay and Daniel Webster 10 years before they wrote the 1850 Compromise, Everett Dirkson who championed civil rights, and Claude Pepper, who defended Social Security and Medicare against revenue raids.
