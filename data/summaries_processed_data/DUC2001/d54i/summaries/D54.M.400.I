In the early 1990's there was a strong move to enact term limitations on elected officials, especially legislators.
Several states were voting on limitations and some factions wanted national action restricting Congressional terms.
Polls revealed 75% of all Americans backed term limits.
Citizens appeared dissatisfied with so few changes in the Congress--96% of incumbents were re-elected during the previous three elections and one in four incumbents had no major party opposition.
Two positions on the issue were expressed by politicians, academics, and journalists.
Those supporting term limitations believed too much power had moved to the legislative branch from the executive branch, which was subjected to limitations.
Political careerism was decried.
Some viewed being in Washington as corrupting people's common sense, while "productive citizens" were not willing to commit more than 6 years to living in Washington.
The inability to unseat an incumbent was blamed on franking privileges and campaign finance laws.
With term limits, some expected candidates to become more dependent on the party for financial assistance and less dependent on special interest groups.
Term limitations were portrayed as constitutional since they did not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of ideology and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court has long reserved to the states the regulation of elections.
While many Democrats believed term-limit supporters were conservatives, some past Democratic leaders were cited as supporting the idea.
Opponents of term limits believed they were illogical, wrong and an insult to voters.
More inexperienced legislators would only increase the power of special interest groups, the unelected Congressional staffers, and Executive branch bureaucrats.
More amateurs would be more vulnerable to corruption.
Legislators would automatically become lame ducks and would be more interested in their next job than their current one.
Terms limits assume the voters don't know what they are doing and would throw the good performers out with the bad.
While some proponents apparently believed the founding fathers supported limits, Hamilton and Madison both wrote against them.
With term limits some of the vital legislation of the past might not have been enacted.
The term limit opponents who agreed that the public was growing dissatisfied with the electoral process suggested other solutions.
Some recommended an end to some of the legislative perquisites and others suggested Congress could become more responsive with overhauls of the committee and seniority systems.
