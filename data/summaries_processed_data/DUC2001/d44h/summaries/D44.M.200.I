The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a controversial issue in 1992 and 1993.
Congress had to ratify the treaty to establish free trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico, by January 1, 1994.
The supporters spent millions of dollars, and included Clinton, the Republican leadership, the business community, and investors.
Opponents included many democrats, labor union members, Ralph Nader, Ross Perot, many U.S. Hispanics and blacks, and ultra-conservatives.
The opponents ran a grassroots operation with a small budget.
As early as June 1992, public opinion did not support NAFTA, and this continued through September 1993.
NAFTA supporters added packages aimed at the environment, labor rights, job assistance programs, and the establishment of a North American Development Bank, which brought support from some environmentalists and Hispanics.
As time for the vote grew short, both sides accelerated efforts.
Clinton's credibility and future effectiveness became tied to the ratification.
After Vice President Gore debated Perot, popular opinion began to shift with one poll in early November putting support at 57%.
Each side began claiming almost enough votes and undecided representatives and their constituents were heavily lobbied.
Following ratification, Caribbean basin nations waited warily to see its impact on them.
