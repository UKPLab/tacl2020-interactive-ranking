Debate and intensive lobbying over the North American Free Trade Agreement went on for years before its final passage in 1993.
Originally proposed during the administration of George H. W. Bush the measure was finally approved by Congress in the administration of Bill Clinton with the active support not only of President Clinton and former President Bush, but also former presidents Carter and Ford.
Opposition to the measure was largely from environmental and labor groups who feared that the agreement would result in a massive loss of jobs to Mexico as employers took advantage of that country's lower wages and less stringent environmental regulations.
The struggle to get the measure approved by the US Congress resulted in strange political bedfellows with Republicans overwhelmingly supporting the measure as Democratic President Clinton went all out lobbying to get 40% support from Democrats in Congress.
Usually loyal Democrat Gephardt opposed NAFTA while Clinton's nemesis Newt Gingrich supported it.
Effective grassroots work by organized labor and environmental groups and high visibility support from sometimes presidential candidate Ross Perot created impressive public opposition to the trade pact, but negotiation of ameliorating side agreements on labor and environmental questions and effective lobbying of Congress eventually won the day for the pro-NAFTA forces.
