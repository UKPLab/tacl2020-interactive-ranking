Ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a controversial issue in 1992 and 1993.
Congress had to ratify the treaty, which would establish free trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, by January 1, 1994.
Supporters of NAFTA spent millions of dollars and were characterized by one person as the "elite".
They included Clinton and his administration, the Republican leadership, the business community, and stock market investors who feared protectionism and an economic decline.
The supporters mandated additional packages aimed at the environment, labor rights, job assistance programs, and the establishment of a North American Development Bank.
These moves brought support from some environmentalists and some U.S. Hispanics.
William Daley, from the Chicago Daley political family, was named NAFTA czar.
He was a skilled, behind the scenes negotiator, with labor ties.
Opponents, characterized as the "populists," included many democrats, labor union members who feared lost jobs and lower wages, Ralph Nader and his Public Opinion group, Ross Perot, U.S. Hispanics who feared recent immigrants would be the first to lose jobs, some environmentalists, many blacks, and ultra-conservatives.
The opponents ran a grassroots operation with a small budget.
Jim Jontz was the anti-NAFTA czar and established national, regional, and state organizations.
As early as June 1992, public opinion did not support NAFTA.
This support continued low, with early September 1993 polls showing 66% of Americans did not support it.
Fifty percent of Americans believed more jobs would be lost than gained and 54% believed wages would go down.
As the November 18 vote grew near, Clinton began making impassioned speeches and inviting representatives to the White House, administration officials visited districts of undecided representatives, and government agencies distributed pro-NAFTA literature.
Clinton's credibility and future effectiveness became tied to the ratification.
The opposition continued rallies, marches, meetings, labor union exhibits, and speeches by workers who had lost their jobs to Mexico.
Vice President Gore won a NAFTA debate with Perot and popular opinion began to shift.
One poll in early November put support at 57%.
Each side began claiming almost enough votes to decide the issue and undecided representatives and their constituents were strongly lobbied by both sides.
Anti-NAFTA forces declared that they had only their personal votes to give, while Clinton had been promising local projects to secure support.
Following ratification of the agreement, Caribbean basin nations waited warily to see its impact on them.
