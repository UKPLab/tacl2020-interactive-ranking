By June 1992 the prospects for the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which had seemed so bright just a few weeks before became clouded.
The proposal supported by President Bush, the Republican establishment, the prospective Democratic presidential nominee, and much of the Democratic congressional leadership now faced growing opposition from followers of independent presidential candidate Ross Perot and from leaders of organized labor who warned of massive job losses to Mexico.
The environment/farm/labor coalition had acquired 200 signatories in the House to a resolution conditioning approval of the pact on strong environment and food safety provisions.
It was too late to get congressional approval of NAFTA before the fall elections and with public opinion apparently swinging against the proposal there was no way to judge what the sentiment on trade would be in the new Congress.
A year later with Bill Clinton now President the situation was no clearer.
Hispanic groups that had been counted upon to support NAFTA found their members divided, preventing the Hispanic congressional caucus from taking a stand.
Hispanic business organizations supported the pact but citizen groups feared that Hispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact and demanded side agreements protecting against environmental and labor abuses.
As the summer progressed anti-NAFTA forces concentrated their lobbying efforts on the general public while pro-NAFTA efforts zeroed in on undecided congressmen and on the side agreements that might win over dubious legislators.
By September polls indicated that 36% of respondents opposed while only 25% supported NAFTA.
Successful negotiation of protective environmental and labor side agreements and intensive lobbying of Congress led by William Daley won over several wavering votes in support of NAFTA, but as the November 17 vote in the House drew near the only certainty was that the vote would be close.
A decisive win by Vice President Al Gore over NAFTA opponent Ross Perot in a widely televised debate seemed to help the NAFTA cause as a poll of debate watchers showed that their support of the pact had shot up from 34% before the debate to 57% after it.
Lobbying by both sides intensified.
Within a few months of the passage of NAFTA, before its effects could really be judged, countries of the Caribbean basin were asking for "parity" with Mexico which would effectively extend the agreement.
