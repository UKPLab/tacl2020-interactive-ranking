THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members, sampling public opinion at home during this Veterans' Day holiday weekend.
The pro-Nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of Vice President Al Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot, hoped they had finally captured the elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the House vote next Wednesday.
A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had shot up from 34 per cent before the debate to 57 per cent after it.
Arthur Andersen Company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US strongly support Nafta.
Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr Perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate.
Mr Perot claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in the US, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and democratic rights.
He said just 34 families owned half the country, and some 85m others lived in poverty.
The Mexican Congress issued a statement, supported by most political parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack and offend Mexicans.
We condemn them as inadmissible and without foundation.'
US opponents of Nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to Mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact.
'The only thing that matters is the economy,' said Mr Christopher Whalen, a Washington trade consultant.
'The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for Nafta will have to look for other employment next year.'
Trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, Congressman David Bonior, an anti-Nafta whip, on Wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434 members pledged to vote against the pact.
However, he needs at least 10-12 votes more than the majority to prevent last-minute switches, as the Administration increases its pressure.
The Administration this week has picked up 10 public endorsement votes, and claims to have a total of 192.
It is publishing a free 800 telephone number with the offer to voters to send, free of charge, pro-Nafta telegrams to their congressman.
Around the country, the opposition troops are planning rallies, marches, town hall meetings and 'accountability meetings' with congressmen.
Ms Lori Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, said Nafta would be won or lost in the congressmen's home districts.
Washington will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend.
The anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a reluctant Congress.
