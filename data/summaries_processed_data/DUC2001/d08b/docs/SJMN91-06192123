Sure, he'll be able to see Thursday's solar eclipse.
But, oh, if only he and the hundreds of other customers could see themselves in the mirror, looking like an audience for a 3-D horror flick.
It appears from the way people in the Golden State have been acting these days that they have been in the sun too long.
Actually, they can't wait to get into the shadow.
Millions of Californians will pause Thursday morning to join in an international ritual: watching the longest-lasting solar eclipse until 2132.
"What other natural phenomenon can you be involved in and not get killed?"

"It's a lot safer than being in a volcano.
"; Eyeshades a hot item; Bay Area people Tuesday were desperately seeking eyeshades.
It took 24 hours for Orion Telescope in Cupertino to sell its stock of 900 Eclipse Viewers, which are made with Mylar plastic lenses and supposedly safe for eclipse viewing.
Welding supply stores were inundated with calls for welder's glasses made with the same plastic.
Local planetariums and observatories were deluged with requests from people wanting to attend solar viewing sessions, even though the Bay Area will be privy only to a partial eclipse - 63 percent coverage of the sun by the moon from 10:10 a.m. to 12:34 p.m.

"I figure we'll get there in time to see the eclipse from a cab," said Wiener, who stood in line at the telescope store Tuesday for the Eclipse Viewers.
"We'll put on the glasses and stick our heads out the window.
"I figure it's worth it.
I don't know if I'll be around for the next one in 150 years.
