A solar eclipse occurs when the moon positions itself between the earth and the sun.
When the sun is totally blacked out by the moon's shadow the eclipse is said to be total.
Scientists who studied an ancient clay tablet found in Syria concluded that it recorded a solar eclipse that occurred in 1213 B.C., making it the oldest known record of a total eclipse.
Some researchers say that the Chinese may have recorded one as early as 2137 B.C.
An eclipse is illusionary because the sun, although 400 times larger than the moon, appears to be covered by the moon, and that because the moon is 400 closer to the earth.
Total eclipses are visible from any single location roughly every 400 years.
Eclipses have provided opportunities for serious scientific studies.
The presence of helium in the sun was first detected during an 1868 eclipse.
The 1919 eclipse offered confirmation of Einstein's theory that the path of light is bent by gravity.
A total eclipse on March 18, 1988 moved along a 108 mile-wide swath from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the Southern Philippines.
The eclipse was partial across a wide area of Asia and parts of Australia.
Another total eclipse on July 21, 1990 and blacked out the sun from Southern Finland across the Kola Peninsula and the northern part of the Soviet Union to the Aleutian Islands.
Residents of parts of western North America viewed a partial eclipse on March 7, 1989.
Most total eclipses get little attention because they occur in isolated areas.
The eclipse of July 11, 1991 received enormous attention.
Preparations in Mexico went on for over a year.
It was called "the solar eclipse of the century".
It reached from Hawaii through Mexico and Central America to Brazil, passing through one of the world's most populous regions, and putting 40 million people in its path.
Darkness in some areas lasted almost seven minutes, the longest possible duration for a total eclipse.
It will be 2132 before the world sees another eclipse of that duration.
Astronomers gathered in observatories to study the phenomenon.
The crowds that flocked to Hawaii and Mexico would have been much larger if facilities had allowed.
Cloud cover hampered visibility in some areas.
Hawaii got an extra thrill when, at the height of the eclipse, the Mauna Loa volcano erupted for the first time in six years.
