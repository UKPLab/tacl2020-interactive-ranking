The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
The high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institute of Technology.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center, there is a higher probability of a major quake in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
While some scientist study data to determine the probability of an earthquake at some future time within a general area, there are others who feel that they can precisely predict when and where a quake will occur.
When Iben Browning, a climatologist, predicted that an earthquake would occur along the New Madrid Fault on a specific date, Schools in Memphis, Tennessee were closed; some residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town.
It turned out to be just another normal day.
In Japan's coastal Tokai region more than 150 geophysical instruments tracks seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal movements and ground water levels.
The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that experts there will recognize unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.
However, Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center said, "There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely."
"There are no two earthquakes alike."
If experts could pinpoint when and where earthquakes would occur, thousands of lives could be saved.
Chile has the distinction of playing host to the largest earthquake ever measured.
On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern Chile.
About 5,000 people were killed.
The earthquake that killed 25,00 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976 when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many.
The annual death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000.
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 severe damage.
A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.
The San Francisco Bay area quake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.
