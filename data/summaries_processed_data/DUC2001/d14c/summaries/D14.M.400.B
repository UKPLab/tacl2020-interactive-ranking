The military aircraft in the U.S. arsenal vary in purpose, size, speed, technology and age.
They operate from hundreds of airbases around the world and aircraft carriers at sea.
Flying them can be dangerous, even fatal.
Aircraft crashes are not uncommon.
In the period from June 1988 through April 1994 innumerable crashes have been reported world wide--two F-16 fighter jets on a training mission near Bodenheim, Germany; an F-16C in a remote area of Iwate Prefecture in Japan; a Navy F-14 fighter plunging into the Atlantic of Hatteras, North Carolina--and many more.
Local and national press coverage is extensive when a crash occurs in or near a densely populated area.
In September 1988 a crippled Navy plane crashed into a hanger at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, California.
Its two crewmembers were able to guide it toward the airbase runway before bailing out.
The jet passed within a mile of an elementary school and narrowly missed a nearby restaurant.
Fortunately, there were only injuries, no fatalities.
The residents of Remscheid, West Germany were not as lucky when a U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt crashed into a working class neighborhood killing six people and severely injuring seven.
The accident further eroded the already sinking public support for Germany's national defense programs.
Even before this fatal crash, 12 major military aircraft accidents had killed 95 people that year alone in Germany, including 70 deaths at an air show accident at the U.S. airbase in Ramstein.
Two weeks after the Remscheid crash, another A-10 Thunderbolt crashed in Britain.
Ironically, this model aircraft has the safest flying record in the U.S. arsenal.
It experiences an accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours.
A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage to an aircraft exceeding $500,000.
In 1990, the estimated 700 warplanes in Saudi Arabia as part of the Operation Desert Shield buildup were given clearance to fly again after a rash of five crashes within two months prompted the military to ground all except operational flights for 24 hours.
Investigators found no common causes or contributing factors in the accidents.
Most recently, a 1994 crash in Okinawa prompted the Japanese Defense Facilities Administration Agency to ask the command of the U.S.
Forces in Japan to take thorough measures for the safe management of the U.S. military bases in Okinawa.
