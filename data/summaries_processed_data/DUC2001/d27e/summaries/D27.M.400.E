The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."
The Supreme Court has, on several occasions, interpreted this amendment as limiting the powers of the federal government and not guaranteeing the right of individuals to bear arms.
Interpretation of the Second Amendment becomes critical when it is used by pro- and anti-gun control advocates.
Leading the gun lobby charge is the National Rifle Association (NRA).
It is an organization of considerable resources and lobbying power.
The cornerstone of its existence is the strict interpretation of the Second Amendment as guaranteeing the right of each individual to bear arms.
Some of the views of the NRA and the gun lobby include: a.
Gun control measures are not effective and do not reduce crime.
b.
Gun availability to the public is a deterrent to crime.
c. The issue is not gun control but rather the breakdown of social institutions.
Gun lobbyists were buoyed by the decision of a Maine judge in 1989.
Maine's constitution previously guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms "for the common defense."
In 1987, a change was made deleting this phrase.
The amendment then read in part that every citizen could keep and bear arms.
With this change, even felons could bear arms.
Gun control advocates interpret the Second Amendment in its 1792 context, that is, it is not a blanket endorsement for gun ownership.
They argue that the Second Amendment provides a basis for gun control legislation.
Licensing and registration, they say, would be similar to the procedures we use for other freedoms.
It is perhaps ironic that the gun control movement in the U.S. sprouted from Roger B. Taney, the racist chief justice of the U.S. and author of the Dred Scott Decision of 1857.
His decision was carried over into the context of the Second Amendment due to the racial paranoia about black men with guns.
This paranoia resulted in restrictions being placed on gun ownership.
There appears to be some light on the horizon for gun proponents.
Some polls show that gun control measures are favored even by gun owners.
Congress has passed the Brady Bill and banned assault weapons.
Perhaps measures like these will begin to solve some of our violence problems with firearms.
