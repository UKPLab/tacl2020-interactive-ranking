In November 1993 the Congress of the United States, after seven long years of debate, passed the Brady Bill requiring a five-day waiting period prior to the purchase of a handgun to give authorities time to check on the background of the purchaser.
This was the first significant national gun-control law to be enacted since the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.
One battle was over, but the war had not been won.
The fight against any meaningful form of gun control had been spearheaded by leaders of the National Rifle Association (NRA), an organization that increased its membership by 700,000 in the two years prior to passage of the Brady Bill.
The NRA immediately went to work fighting any further gun-control laws and seeking electoral defeat of legislators who supported any such measures.
The debate went on, centered, as it always had been, on the exact meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The Second Amendment states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."
Opponents of gun control argue that the amendment spells out an individual right of American citizens to own and possess firearms without government interference.
Proponents of gun control say the reference to a "well regulated militia" shows that it concerns only the states' right to maintain militias without interference from the federal government.
Opponents answer: "Since everyone agrees that the right of the people' elsewhere in the Bill of Rights means a right for individual citizens, why in the case of the Second Amendment should it mean just a state's right to be protected from the federal government?"
The Supreme Court's decisions, while not definitive, tend to support the position that it pertains to the states' right to have militias.
Aside from the Second Amendment, gun-control advocates point to the proliferation of handguns and assault weapons and the high levels of violent crime in the United States while opponents assert that criminals aren't affected by gun-control laws and the possession of weapons is the individual's only means of self-protection and defense against tyranny.
The NRA president was quoted as saying, "But look at what happened in Germany when ol' Hitler did a good job in disarming the nation."
The debate goes on.
