The Shining Path is a Maoist splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party and was founded in 1970 by Abimael Guzman.
This group sought to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state.
It first worked with peasants in the Andean highlands, gaining support from long-persecuted Indians.
The group began guerrilla operations in 1980 and, by the mid-1980's, began to move into the jungles, providing protection for coca growers.
By 1988, the government claimed the fighting had taken 15,000 lives and caused $10 million in property damage.
Involvement in urban areas began in 1987.
Until Fujimori was elected president in 1990, Peruvian presidents had not been successful in handling the Shining Path, but by 1994, many leaders of the group, including Guzman, were in jail.
A faction of free guerrillas led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," had formed and was beginning to assert power.
According to a Peruvian subversion specialist, the government hoped to strengthen Guzman's position, allowing him to organize a second party congress from jail, which would recommend disarmament and end of violence.
In February 1994, the Feliciano faction repudiated all peace efforts and called for continuation of the people's war.
