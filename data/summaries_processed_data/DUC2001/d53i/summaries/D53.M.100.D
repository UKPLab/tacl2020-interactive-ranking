Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains of Peru and claimed to be defenders of impoverished Peruvian coca farmers, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in the makeshift communities near the capital where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people live.
The guerrillas demand that farmers pay for protection from anti-drug police with one-fifth of their coca crop.
They also banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley.
Though a number of top Shining Path leaders were arrested by authorities, the Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members who remain free, decided to continue the "people's war."
