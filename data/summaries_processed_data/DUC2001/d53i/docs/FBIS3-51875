The Shining Path does not intend to seek reconciliation in the country, has disarmed itself neither militarily nor ideologically, and is instead trying to become a semi-legal party operating as a shock force against the opposition, subversion specialist Carlos Tapia has said.
Tapia emphasized that the Shining Path faction led by Abimael Guzman Reinoso enjoys government favor, and among other things has been given assistance in organizing a second party congress.
He said that imprisoned Shining Path members of the Guzman-led faction, such as Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, have been allowed to tour several prisons and to promote debates to support the proposal of so-called President Gonzalo.
Tapia said: "The Shining Path was defeated, but it seems that after the beginning of negotiations, Abimael Guzman's leadership has been consolidated, tied to the commitment to organize a second party congress."
"The documents of this second congress are being prepared to make the Shining Path stop engaging in armed actions.
It is true that armed actions will end, but no one knows when.
A new, stronger Shining Path could reemerge later for a second beginning, and as a weapon for fighting popular movements ," Tapia said.
He added that peace negotiations between the Shining Path and the government are being held behind the country's back.
Tapia believes the government is seeking to strengthen Abimael Guzman's leadership within Shining Path, countering the hardline faction led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano."
Guzman's faction, Tapia said, represents the imprisoned Shining Path, while the one led by "Feliciano" is made up of the terrorists who are still free.
"They are the ones who plant the bombs," he said.
For his part, ex-leftist Senator Enrique Bernales has said that the Guzman group is trying to sell itself in order to eventually gain its freedom and later regroup.
Tapia and Bernales made these statements during an interview on the "En Directo" program hosted by Alfredo Barnechea on Channel 9.
The statements were made in the wake of a letter that Shining Path member Edmundo Cox addressed to Colonel Gabino Cajahuanca, the director of the Miguel Castro Castro prison, asking him for an audience "to inform you about what we have done."
Cox was referring to the meetings he held with imprisoned Shining Path members in other prisons of the country to support the peace proposal by Guzman Reinoso, against the faction led by "Feliciano."
Carlos Tapia, who is a careful observer of the subversion phenomenon, believes that the Shining Path does not seek national reconciliation, and that it maintains its ideological positions, such as "hatred of classes" and its stand against the "legal leftist sector, human rights organizations, popular unions, and nongovernmental organizations."
