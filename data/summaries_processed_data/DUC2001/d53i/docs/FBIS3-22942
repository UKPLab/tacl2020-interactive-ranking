Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) - The "Sunday Review" television program said that according to a "very reliable source," the end of the "popular war," the surrender of weapons, and a general amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement "without victors or vanquished," between the Shining Path and the Peruvian Government.
The administration of President Alberto Fujimori has admitted that talks, led by Abimael Guzman who has been serving a life sentence since October 1992, are being held between government representatives and Shining Path leaders in prison.
No details, however, have been issued on discussions or possible agreements.
According to the "Sunday Review" program, directed by journalist Nicolas Lucar on the Lima America Channel 4 Television Network, the 10-point agreement says its main aspect is to "stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and propaganda."
Another point refers to "dismantling the People's Guerrilla Army with their surrender and the destruction of their weapons."
It also includes the self-dismantling of the people's committees and the Shining Path's support base throughout the country.
A general amnesty has been mentioned and a process whereby, "little by little and in accordance with the circumstances, prisoners of war and political prisoners will be released and their sentences reduced."
Together with the "improvement of relations between both parties," it is also stressed that the agreement would be without "conquerors or vanquished," and would ease the way for the return of those Shining Path members living abroad "in order to recover the country's social and normal life."
The agreement would entail a "cessation of hostilities toward relatives of Shining Path members" and "the movement's archives, library, museum, and other symbols would also be returned."
One of the points in the agreement mentions the need for "economic support and investments in the areas devastated by the war."
So far, government authorities have not denied or rejected the accuracy of this agreement between the government and Shining Path.
