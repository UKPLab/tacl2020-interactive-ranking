The issue of whether or not to include illegal aliens in the 1990 census count occupied the U.S. Congress for more than eighteen months before the issue was resolved in favor of inclusion in October 1989.
The Senate favored exclusion while the House favored inclusion.
The issue was finally settled by House-Senate Conference.
