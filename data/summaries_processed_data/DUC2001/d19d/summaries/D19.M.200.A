In February 1988 some 40 members of Congress, largely from states with few illegal aliens, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform proposed that illegal aliens be excluded from the count in the 1990 census that would be used for reapportionment of Congressional seats.
They argued that these people were not legal citizens and should not be represented in Congress.
Debate in the House and Senate pitted these advocates of exclusion against Congresspeople from states with large populations of illegal immigrants and others who argued that exclusion would violate the constitutional requirement that representation be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states; that there was no precedent for exclusion; that many federal aid programs were based on these census figures, and states most influenced by the surge in immigration would lose funds needed to deal with attendant problems; and attempts to determine whether immigrants were legal would discourage all immigrants from cooperating with the census.
In 1989 the Senate twice voted in favor of exclusion.
In each case the House refused to accept the Senate's verdict, so finally the matter was referred to Senate-House conference and on October 19, 1989 the negotiators agreed that illegal immigrants would be counted in the 1990 census.
