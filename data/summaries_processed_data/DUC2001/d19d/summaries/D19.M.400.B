As the1990 census rapidly approaches, Congress is contentiously debating whether we should continue the practice of counting illegal aliens in our population.
It is estimated there are 3 to 8 million of them in the U.S.
The Census Bureau claims it would be very difficult to exclude illegal aliens from their count.
The issue is very important for two reasons.
One, because a great amount of federal money is allocated to states based on census population numbers.
The more people counted, the more money the state will get.
And two, House reapportionment, also based on population, is a zero sum game.
The number of House seats is set by law at 435.
A state can only gain a seat at the expense of another losing one.
Many Congressmen argue that counting all people, including illegal aliens, is a constitutional requirement.
The Constitution does not mention "citizens", but rather, instructs that House apportionment be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states.
Their interpretation was upheld by a federal appeals court prior to the 1980 census.
Those seeking the disallowance of illegal aliens say that the framers of the Constitution were unaware of the issue.
"Illegal aliens" did not exist in the U.S. until restrictive immigration laws were passed in 1875.
They argue further that it is not right to have the representation of legal residents diluted by the count of those who broke our laws to get here in the first place.
Eventually the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Shelby, D-AL to ban the count of illegal aliens.
The issue remained open much longer in the House, where Rep. Tom Ridge, R-PA, led the fight to disallow the counting of illegal aliens.
He offered a compromise whereby they would be counted in the population but excluded for purposes of reapportionment.
Eventually the House voted to count illegal aliens and also count a formally excluded group, military personnel living overseas.
It appears a House-Senate conference committee will endorse this result.
California is believed to have up to half of all illegal aliens in the U.S.
Counting illegal aliens will most likely result in an additional $300 million in federal aid to the state, plus an additional House seat.
Pennsylvania will have one less seat.
Seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama are at risk, while Texas, Florida and New York might benefit.
