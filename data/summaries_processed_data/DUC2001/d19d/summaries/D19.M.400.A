In February 1988 some 40 members of Congress joined with the Federation for American Immigration Reform to press for exclusion of illegal aliens from the count in the 1990 census that would be used for reapportioning Congressional seats.
The group contended that including the estimated 2 million or more illegal aliens would cause unfair shifts of seats from one state to another.
Debate in the House and Senate pitted members from states with few illegal aliens (favoring exclusion) against those from states with a large number of undocumented immigrants (opposing exclusion).
The in favor claimed that counting illegal aliens would violate citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congress to states where aliens live.
It would violate the principle of one man, one vote.
It was not right to grant representation in Congress to individuals who had entered the U.S. by breaking its laws.
One proponent of exclusion declared that counting illegal aliens "...may be constitutional, but it's just not right."
Census officials and those opposed to the exclusion had an advantage in arguments based on the Constitution, precedent and legal reasoning.
The Constitution instructs that House apportionment be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states and does not use the term "citizen" in this regard although it is used elsewhere in the Constitution.
This interpretation was upheld by a federal court in a ruling prior to the 1980 census.
All past censuses had counted all the "persons" residing in the states.
Furthermore, the Census Bureau termed the exclusion unworkable since they had no means to determine who was legal and illegal and any attempt to find out threatened the chance of cooperation from immigrants.
Aside from reapportionment there was a practical consideration for states that had experienced a surge in immigration: they had enormous additional costs and needed available federal aid based on the census figures.
In July 1989 the U.S. Senate voted for an immigration bill calling on the Census Bureau to exclude illegal aliens from the count.
The House blocked the measure in August.
Despite strong opposition from the Bush Administration, in September the Senate attached a similar amendment to the appropriations bill for the State Justice and Commerce departments.
The bill was referred to a Senate-House conference and on October 19, 1989 the negotiators announced that illegal aliens would be counted in the 1990 census.
