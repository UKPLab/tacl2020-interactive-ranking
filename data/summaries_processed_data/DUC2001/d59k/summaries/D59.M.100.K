A survey of some of the plane crashes between 1987 and 1991 reveals a number of probable causes, although some remain unknown.
In 1987, an airliner crashed on takeoff in Detroit when an engine failed, killing 154, while a British jet crashed on landing after one engine caught fire and the pilot shut down the other in error.
A United DC-10 experienced total hydraulic failure after an engine exploded, causing a crash landing.
Two planes exploded due to terrorist bombings, while three crashed in bad weather.
One crashed into a mountain; another, into woods.
All are under investigation.
