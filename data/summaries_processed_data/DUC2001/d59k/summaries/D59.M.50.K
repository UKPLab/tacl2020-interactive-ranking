A number of domestic and foreign planes crashed during the years 1987-1991.
Some of the suspected causes are mechanical failure, pilot error, extreme weather and terrorist activity.
Occasionally causes overlap, such as pilot error during a mechanical crisis, or navigational problems in bad weather.
Some crashes remain a mystery.
