Domestic and foreign airlines as well as privately-owned aircraft suffered a series of air disasters resulting in the loss of many lives during the period 1960 to 1991.
An examination of selected reports concerning these disasters reveals that terrorist bombs, mechanical failures, pilot errors and weather factors have been possible causes.
In the terrorist bombs category, a Boeing 747 was the victim as it exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December, 1988.
Officials believed it was a terrorist act because of the scattering of wreckage and the sudden loss of contact with the plane.
Similarly, on 19 September, 1989, a French DC-10 exploded and crashed after departing Chad.
Once again, the debris field was widely scattered and air controllers suddenly lost contact with the plane.
Pilot error category included two crashes in 1989.
The first of these was a Boeing 737.
During flight, a functioning engine was shut down while a mal-functioning one was allowed to operate.
Flight recorders confirmed that the crew shut down the wrong engine.
Pilot error also may have been a contributing cause for the crash of a plane with Congressman Mickey Leland (D-Texas) and 15 others on board on 13 August 1989.
The plane crashed into a mountain peak in Ethiopia.
Weather factors figured in the crash of a Cessna on 17 May 1988 near Albuquerque.
The plane nosed into the ground, probably from wind shear.
Wind shear was also a possible factor on 3 March 1991.
On that date, a Boeing 737 nosed into the ground near Colorado Springs.
Wind shear warnings had been issued.
Weather also may have been involved in the crash of a light plane that claimed the life of Congressman Larkin Smith (R-Mississippi) on 13 August, 1989.
Mechanical failures figured in two prominent crashes in 1987 and 1989.
A MD-82 aircraft crashed on 16 August 1987 in Detroit.
Engine failure was a likely cause.
There was not much doubt about the cause of the crash of a DC-10 at Sioux City, Iowa on 19 July 1989.
The plane's tail engine exploded, there was a complete hydraulic failure, and the right engine failed.
The loss of life and injuries from air crashes reached serious proportions by 1987.
So much so that there was considerable pressure for a complete review of air safety measures.
Between 1960 and 1985, there were ten air crashes by U.S. domestic carriers resulting in 1348 deaths.
