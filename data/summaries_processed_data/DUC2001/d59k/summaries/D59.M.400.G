The following is an account of serious airplane crashes reported during the period August 1987 to March 1991.
A Northwest Airlines jet crashed in Detroit in August of 1987 killing at least 154 people.
Engine failure appeared to be the culprit.
In May 1988, five people aboard were killed when a single-engine airplane crashed on the outskirts of Albuquerque while trying to land at nearby Coronado Airport.
High winds may have been the cause.
On 22 December 1988, a Pan Am Boeing 747 apparently exploded in mid-air over Lockerbie, Scotland, 54 minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow Airport.
All 259 people aboard the plane and 22 people on the ground were killed.
The AP office in London received an anonymous call saying the crash was retaliation by the "Guardians of the Islamic Revolution" for the downing of an Iran Air Airbus by a US cruiser back in July.
In January 1989, authorities questioned the injured pilot of a Boeing 737 that crashed short of the runway at East Midlands Airport in England.
There were no clues as to why the plane's undamaged right engine was shut down while the other engine burned.
A United Airlines DC-10 crashed short of a runway in July 1989 while making an emergency landing at Sioux Gateway Airport in Iowa, killing at least 123 of the 293 aboard.
It was speculated that an explosion of the tail engine was the problem.
In mid-August 1989, the wreckage of a plan that crashed against a mountain in Ethiopia with Congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard was found by US rescue and recovery teams.
Indications are that the passengers and crew died instantly.
Leland was Chairman of the House Elect Committee on Hunger and was on his sixth tour of refugee camps.
The following day, Congressman Larkin Smith (D-Miss), known on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs, died in a light plane crash in Mississippi.
A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 aboard blew up at high altitude over a desert region of Niger in September 1989.
The plane may have been bombed by terrorists in retaliation against France for sending a naval task force into Lebanese waters too rescue French nationals in war-torn Lebanon.
A United Airlines Boeing 707 jetliner crashed near Colorado Spring Municipal Airport in early March 1991 killing all 25 persons aboard.
There were no indications on why it crashed.
