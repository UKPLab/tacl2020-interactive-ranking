Here, at a glance, are developments today involving the crash of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 Wednesday night in Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 people on the ground: The jumbo jet, a Boeing 747, apparently exploded in the air before crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats to place a bomb on a Pan Am airliner.
The crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow Airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
The only possible cause immediately ruled out was a collision with another aircraft.
Searchers recovered both the airplane's flight recorders.
Scottish Secretary Malcom Rifkind, the chief British official at the site, said the widespread wreckage indicated ``the aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion.''
The wreckage of the 747 scattered bodies and debris over 10 miles of countryside and ravaged the village of Lockerbie.
Twenty-two people were killed on the ground, most of them in cars hits by wreckage, authorities said.
Forty houses were destroyed when the plane crashed.
The International Air Transport Association believes sabotage is the most likely explanation for the crash.
David Kyd, chief public relations officer, said ``it would seem to us that the most likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard,'' and that structural problems were unlikely to have been involved in the crash because of the sudden loss of contact with the plane.
The 747 has a reputation for ruggedness and is able to stay aloft even with serious damage to the structure.
The State Department warned U.S. embassies that a bomb threat had been made against Pan Am jetliners flying from Frankfurt to the United States 2{ weeks ago and the Federal Aviation Administration told Pan Am this month that the airline might be the target of a terrorist bombing.
An unidentified U.S. government source said a a person claiming to belong to the Abu Nidal group, a radical Palestinian faction, telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, about two weeks ago and said a bomb would be placed aboard a Pan Am plane and that it would be carried by a woman.
An anonymous caller to the AP office in London claimed responsibility for the crash and said it was in retaliation for the downing of an Iran Air Airbus by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in July.
``We, the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, are undertaking this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the Iran air plane by America a few months ago and keeping the Shah's family in America.
We are very proud,'' the male caller said, then hung up quickly.
A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization said it was ``nonsensical'' to link Palestinians to the crash.
``It cannot possibly occur to the Palestinians or the Arabs to commit such an act,'' Mahmoud Abbas, code-named Abu-Mazen, told reporters when asked about reports that the plane may have been downed by sabotage.
The jumbo jet that crashed had at least 24 mechanical problems during the past eight years, including cracks, severe corrosion and an on-board fire, according to FAA service records.
FAA spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane said there have been problems with minor cracks in 747s over the past few years, but inspections did not find much cracking.
``Those are certainly very reliable airplanes,'' she said, adding that the problems reported did not appear unusual given the length of time the plane had been in service.
Officials at Pratt Whitney in said they doubted their engines, which powered the aircraft, caused the crash, and that the plane could have continued to fly even if three of the four engines failed at once.
