An Anglo-French consortium constructed the 31-mile long "chunnel" between Folkestone and Calais.
The work was arduous, costly and dangerous.
The "chunnel" opened in 1944, significantly cutting travel time between Paris and London.
The French liked it.
The British considered it a threat to their island identity.
