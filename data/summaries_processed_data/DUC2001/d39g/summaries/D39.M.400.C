In 1802 Napoleon advanced the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel, but the English quickly disabused him of that idea.
Since then there have been abortive starts on a tunnel.
The impetus needed to guarantee the completion of a tunnel came with the imminent approach of free trade among European nations.
A treaty authorizing the construction of a tunnel was signed in 1986.
It was soon dubbed "the Chunnel".
Construction was to be financed by private capital, and no direct governmental subsidies would be allowed.
TransManche Link, a consortium of French and English companies, would be responsible for tunnel construction.
It would be the biggest European civil- engineering project of the century.
Twenty-three miles of the tunnel would be under water.
The tunnel would emerge from the ground a few miles inland on both ends, making its length about 31 miles.
There would be three separate adjoining tunnels, a smaller service tunnel and two larger one-way train tunnels.
i In December digging began from the French terminal at Sangatte, near Calais, and from the English terminal near Folkestone.
Giant machines simultaneously dig, remove rock and erect walls.
Progress was slow on the English side, and even slower on the French side where the workers encountered a more complex geological environment.
Even so, by June 1990 the tunnel was half dug.
France enthusiastically supported the tunnel as a great project in the national interest, and expected it to resuscitate the lagging economy in its northeastern sector.
In England the tunnel was unpopular from the start.
Some industrialists and trading companies saw a benefit, but the general public saw it as an evil.
They feared that it would destroy England's insular identity and allow an influx of everything bad, from rabies to terrorists.
The service tunnel was completed first, and then the two train tunnels.
The "chunnel" was scheduled for formal opening on May 6, 1994.
Construction costs, originally estimated at 16.7 billion dollars, had risen to almost 16,7 billion dollars.
Nine lives had been lost.
The projected rail travel time from London to Paris would be three and one-half hours.
Higher property values were expected in areas near the tunnel's terminals.
Even Belgium, because of its proximity to Calais, was hoping for a boost to its economy.
