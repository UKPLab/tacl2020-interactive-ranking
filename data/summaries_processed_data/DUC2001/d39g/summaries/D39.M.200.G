On 1 December 1990, British and French workers digging the 31-mile tunnel or "chunnel" between Dover, England and the coast of France since 1988, finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through.
Construction was expected to be completed by May 1994.
It has reinforced historic trading links, enabled freight to travel on a single track instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry trip, and cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three.
Some wondered initially whether Britain would be ready for it.
Polls showed that the English did not want a fixed link, were afraid of rabies, rats and terrorists crawling through.
In SE England, the rural English were reluctant to have high-speed trains screaming through their backyards.
The chunnel was viewed positively in France where it was hoped that the project would revitalize depressed northern regions where the tunnel surfaced.
Areas for development were the property market in northeastern France as buyer and entrepreneurs set up a base on the Continent; increasing traffic as holidaymakers and freight carriers headed for the tunnel; and tourism.
On the negative side, the tunnel's completion could aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental Europe.
