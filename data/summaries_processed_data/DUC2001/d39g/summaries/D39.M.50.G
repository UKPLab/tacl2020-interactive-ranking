The 31-mile "chunnel" between England and France was expected to be completed by May 1994, cutting the London-Paris journey from six hours to three.
The English initially protested that rabies, rats and terrorists would come through.
The French viewed the chunnel positively, expecting it to revitalize their depressed northern region.
