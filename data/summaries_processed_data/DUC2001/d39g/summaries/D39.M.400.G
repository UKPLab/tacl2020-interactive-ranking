Construction of a 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it under water, underway since 1988 between Dover, England and the coast of France, was expected to be completed by May 1994.
The "chunnel" was a symbol of European unity.
It reinforced historically dominant trading links (London - Frankfurt - Milan), cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three hours, and enabled freight to travel on a single train instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry trip.
Some wondered initially whether Britain was ready for it.
Nationwide opinion polls about the chunnel showed that the English did not want a fixed link; liked ferries and their island story; were afraid of long, dark tunnels underwater and rabies, not to mention European undesirables.
In addition, critics said that obsolete commuter lines in SE England would cause delays and the rural English were reluctant to have high-speed trains screaming through their backyards.
Moreover, in June 1990, the British government refused to fund a high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel, telling the consortium formed to build the link that the contribution would involve "unacceptable" risks to the taxpayers.
The construction was almost 60% over budget with contractors embroiled in a dispute over $1.7 in overruns and scrambling for more investment money.
The tunnel was viewed positively in France because it surfaced in one of their most depressed areas, hence the French were forging ahead with a high-speed rail link.
France hoped the project would revitalize the depressed northern regions.
The chunnel was to be a starting point for recovery in the property market in northeastern France.
Prospective buyers included hauliers who wanted to set up a base on the Continent and Asian entrepreneurs who saw advantage in being close to Belgium.
Main areas for development were increasing traffic as holidaymakers and freight carriers headed for the tunnel opening in Calais, and tourism throughout the attractive, open green spaces.
On the negative side, a study released in Paris said the tunnel's completion would aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental Europe.
In addition, Belgium's biggest ports would suffer a loss in traffic.
In October 1990, the first land link between Britain and France was created when British workers sent a two-inch wide probe through to their French colleagues.
On 1 December 1990, British and French workers digging the tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through.
