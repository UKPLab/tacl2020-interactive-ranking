In 1802 Napoleon talked about a tunnel under the English Channel, but his idea went nowhere.
Since that time there have been several abortive attempts toward that goal.
The imminent approach of free trade in Europe impelled the Britain and France toward a treaty authorizing a tunnel.
The tunnel, soon known as the "chunnel" would be built by the TransManche Link, a consortium of British and French companies.
A service tunnel and two one-way train tunnels would extend for 31 miles, from near Calais to near Folkestone, with 23 miles under the seabed.
France supported tunnel construction, and expected it to benefit the economy in its northeast sector.
Most English were opposed to the tunnel, claiming its insular identity would be threatened by a host of continental afflictions.
Tunnel construction started in 1987.
Progress was slow and formal opening ceremonies weren't scheduled until May 6, 1994.
Construction costs totaled at least 16.4 billion dollars.
Nine construction workers were killed.
The projected rail travel time from London to Paris would be lowered to three and one-half hours.
Values for property near the terminals on both sides of the channel are expected to increase.
