McDonald's moved into new markets, opening restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the first communist country to get a McDonald's, the Soviet Union, and China.
The opening day crowds were large and enthusiastic about the flavor of the Big Mac.
The openings came after years of negotiations which, in some cases, stipulated that McDonald's buy its supplies locally.
