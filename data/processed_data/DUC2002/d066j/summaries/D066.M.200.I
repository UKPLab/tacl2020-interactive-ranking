Wal-Mart founder, Sam Walton, who died in April 1992, revolutionized discount retailing.
Born in Oklahoma, the son of a mortgage banker, he became the richest man in America and the second richest in the world.
After a tour in the army and working in and owning retailing outlets, he founded Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.
He took discount shopping to rural America and by 1992 Wal-Mart was the world's largest retailer.
Success can be attributed to Sam's personality.
He was frugal, hardworking, old- fashioned, and homespun.
He declared the customer always right and continually nurtured employee satisfaction with bonus payments, profit-sharing plans, and a responsive, streamlined, management system.
He was known for pop-in visits, talking with customers, and personally helping out in an emergency.
Sam Walton also worked to preserve his personal legacy.
In 1990 the Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Visitors Center opened to chronicle the rise of the chain.
He also wrote his autobiography, filling it with anecdotes about his "good ole" common sense.
A scholarly book was released in 1994, which highlighted his ability to copy and adapt and addressed some of the negative aspects of the giant chain, including its anti-union stand and its impact on small town Mom-and-Pop stores.
