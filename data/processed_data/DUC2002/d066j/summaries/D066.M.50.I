Sam Walton revolutionized discount retailing, at the same time becoming the richest man in America.
He took discount shopping to rural America with Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer.
His down-home personality, chronicled in his autobiography and the Wal-Mart visitor's center, permeated the chain's operations.
Scholars also credit his adaptability and responsive management.
