In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing 444 seats.
One editorial claims some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major, and there is speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.
A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher when she resigned under pressure in November 1990.
After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office, Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, and it was expected that there would be no significant policy shift.
Major's comment while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard- line on the Persian Gulf.
Within a year of winning the general election, his popularity had plunged.
In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015 the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.
Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader, lacking vision and political conviction.
Not even recent revelations that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.
