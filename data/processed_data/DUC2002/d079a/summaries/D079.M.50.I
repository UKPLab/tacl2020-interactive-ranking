Gilbert is now a tropical storm, bringing heavy rains, flooding, and mudslides to areas of northeastern Mexico.
Gilbert at one time was the most intense hurricane recorded and brought havoc to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
Gilbert's center avoided Texas, although it spawned tornadoes along the coast.
