Since roaring to life about two weeks ago, explosions at Mount Pinatubo, located 10 miles from Clark AFB in the Philippines, have become increasingly severe.
The first eruptions shot gas, steam and ash 12,000 feet above the mountain.
Today's eruptions spewed matter over 12 miles high, and a possible lava flow was seen for the first time.
Clark, evacuated nearly a week ago, is covered in ash, as is Subic Bay naval base, which received the 16,000 Clark evacuees.
U.S. officials, while not commenting on whether nuclear weapons are at the abandoned base, denied the possibility of radioactive contamination if molten rock hits the weapons depots.
At least four deaths and 24 people injured have been recorded since Pinatubo began erupting after six centuries of dormancy.
About 84,000 have been evacuated.
Heavy rains today have raised fears of catastrophic mudflows.
Pinatubo is in the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific.
Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring, recently erupted, killing 38.
President Aquino toured refugee centers and authorized the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts.
According to Foreign Secretary Manglapus, the eruptions should not effect the stalled talks with the U.S. on new Clark and Subic lease agreements.
