Since Saturday, the ferocious Hurricane Gilbert has roared through the Greater Antilles.
Gilbert killed five in the Dominican Republic and hit Jamaica with its full force, killing 19 and causing extensive damage.
Its 160 mph winds pummeled Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, causing flooding and outages.
Forecasters ask why did Gilbert become so intense?
