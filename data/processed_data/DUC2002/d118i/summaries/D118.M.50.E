Former Texas Senator John Tower was killed in the crash of a commuter plane off the coast of Georgia.
Senator Tower had been President Bush's nominee for Secretary of Defense.
The Senate rejected the nomination following allegations of problems with alcohol and inappropriate dealings with defense contractors.
