A violent storm that spawned tornadoes and thunderstorms across the Midwest and South then blew north knocking over a school cafeteria wall in upstate New York, killing seven children.
Altogether, fourteen states and Washington D.C. were affected.
The toll from the two-day storm is at least 27 dead and over 500 hundred injured.
Property damage is in the millions.
Hundreds have been left homeless and tens of thousands lost electricity.
The worst damage by far was in Huntsville, Alabama where a massive tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school, leaving at least 14 dead and injuring nearly 300.
It touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. when city streets were filled with rush hour traffic.
Ike Carroll, a real estate broker, said, "It started picking up cars and pushing them around, some of them upside down, some of them strewn around.
Heavy overhead power lines started snapping just like a circus performer would snap his whip."
Governor Guy Hunt called in State Troopers from throughout the state to help.
He is also using the National Guard to assist in the cleanup and to protect against looting.
The Governor plans to ask President Bush to declare Huntsville a disaster area.
