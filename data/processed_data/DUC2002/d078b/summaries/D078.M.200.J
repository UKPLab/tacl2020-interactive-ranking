Director Spike Lee, speaking at Syracuse University Monday, shrugged off the treatment of his movie by Academy Award voters.
Though praised by critics, his 1989 film was not considered in the best picture or best director categories.
The Academy, however, has a history of overlooking achievers.
In 1988, directors James Brooks and Steven Speilberg were both passed over.
Selection for the award is under scrutiny as studios mount major campaigns to influence voting.
On average a best picture award is worth about $20 million, but there is no guarantee that Academy members actually complete their own ballots.
Millions watch the awards presentation.
The last awards show took a long three plus hours.
The opening number, a song-and-dance routine by Eileen Bowman portraying Snow White, was particularly lamentable and led to a Disney suit against the Academy for its unauthorized use of the character.
Though long, the 1989 ceremony will be favorably remembered for the spread of the awards.
Ten movies split 17 awards.
The Oscar, created in 1928, is one of the most recognizable symbols in the entertainment world and is not protected by copyright.
Katherine Hepburn and Walter Brennan are the actress and actor, respectively, with the most awards.
