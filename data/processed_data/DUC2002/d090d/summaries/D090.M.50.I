Philippine President Corazon Aquino was beset with problems from 1988 to 1990.
Ferdinand Marcos plagued the earlier years, even when he became terminally ill. Economic problems, agrarian reform, overseas Filipinos, Communist insurgents, and the mutinous military tormented her administration.
Coup attempts continued even after she sought reconciliation.
