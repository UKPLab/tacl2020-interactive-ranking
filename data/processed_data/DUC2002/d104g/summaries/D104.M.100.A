The military assault on pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square on June 3-4, 1989 cost at least 2,600 lives and perhaps as many as 12,000.
2,000 students had encamped in the square and begun a hunger strike in May and a million citizens rallied to their support.
When the declaration of martial law did not intimidate the students and their supporters, the government resorted to the use of massive force.
The pro- democracy movement started after the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989 with students shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang!
Long live democracy!"
