Chinese troops fought through crowds of protesters on 3 June 1989, killing thousands as they crushed the reform-minded student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
Surviving students fled the square, ending their defiant three-week occupation of the square.
Later demonstrations in other Chinese cities protested the Beijing slaughter.
