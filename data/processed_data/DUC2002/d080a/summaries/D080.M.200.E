The McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, the longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history ended with the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 charges.
A decision has yet to be reached on whether to retry Buckey on the 13 charges on which the jury deadlocked.
The case originally involved Buckey and his mother, as well as his sister and grandmother and three other employees of the school.
The charges against the sister, grandmother and the three employees were dropped for lack of evidence.
In reaching their verdict, the jury said that the videotaped interviews of the child were a factor in finding the Buckeys innocent.
The jurors felt the interviewers asked leading questions and never allowed the children to tell their own story.
A number of the jurors stated that they believed some of the children had been molested but that the prosecution had not proven that Raymond Buckey was responsible.
The verdict was greeted with anger by the parents of the children involved who felt the prosecution and the legal system had let them down.
The judge in the case remarked that the case had poisoned everyone it touched.
