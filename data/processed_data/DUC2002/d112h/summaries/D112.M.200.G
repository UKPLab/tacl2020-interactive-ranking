British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, publisher of Britain's Daily Mirror, bought the New York Daily News in 1990.
He then planned to raise $448 million through the sale of shares in his Mirror Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain.
He bought Mirror Group in 1984 and turned it into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups.
A year after the Daily News purchase, he was found dead in the waters off the Canary Island where he was vacationing on his yacht.
Investigators say Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts.
Some $630 million was taken from his Mirror Group pension fund without authority.
His sons Kevin and Ian, who took over the business, were investigated and found guilty for their knowledge of illegal schemes using two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank to support the Maxwell Communications Company (MCC).
In a flurry of foreign exchange deals, the MCC would buy currency in one financial center promising, but often failing, to make payment in another center; thus getting an unauthorized loan.
Some repayments were made by looting pension funds assets.
