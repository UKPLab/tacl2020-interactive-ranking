New treatments are contributing to the decrease in deaths from heart attacks over the past decade.
Experts also credit the decline to healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food.
Aspirin has shown great promise, cutting heart attack risk in half, but for people who have clotting problems or high blood pressure, aspirin seems to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
Other promising drugs include, diltiazen, which can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, Verapanil, which cuts the risk of new heart attacks and death by 20% in people recovering from heart attacks and a natural substance known as TGF which appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.
Another drug known as TPA dissolves clots in the heart's arteries and is as effective for most patients as angioplasty.
The use of TPA may help heart attack victims leave the hospital in as early as three days.
Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine, reducing the risk of second heart attacks and a blood and urine test, measuring a blood protein called renin, can help to identify those at risk for a heart attack.
