Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was the surprise choice of Republican George Bush for presidential running mate in 1988.
Quayle was compared to John F. Kennedy because of their similar ages and congressional service, and to Robert Redford in appearance.
Quayle was criticized as a novice and his National Guard service attacked.
His campaign gaffes made news, but he was loyal to Bush and a team player.
After controversies subsided he kept a low profile.
A year after the election he agreed to be on "Meet the Press", shortly after Bush announced he would be on the ticket in 1992, and was uncontroversial.
Quayle grew up in Huntington, Indiana, population 17,000, where his grandfather owned the newspaper.
He graduated from DePauw University in 1969, spent six months in National Guard training, then in 1971 investigated consumer problems in the Indiana Attorney General's office and became an aide to the governor.
While attending Indiana University Law School he met and married his wife Marilyn.
They jointly practiced law in Huntington before Quayle spent 12 years in the US Congress.
Quayle has three children and is known as a nice guy with good values.
In 1991, Huntington hosted an exhibit in his honor, which he didn't attend because of a busy schedule.
