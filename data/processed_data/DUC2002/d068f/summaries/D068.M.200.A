On June 22, 1990 Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was hoisted by a huge crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum.
The guardhouse, constructed after erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was the scene of many successful and unsuccessful attempts at escape from East Berlin and had become a symbol of the Cold War.
By June of 1990 with the Berlin Wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, and with top diplomats of the two Germanys and the four World War II allies meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city after unification, U.S. officials decided it was time to remove the famous landmark.
The foreign ministers attended an elaborate ceremony to honor the symbolic act.
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze took the occasion to modify the previous Soviet firm opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, proposing that such a step be allowed after a five-year waiting period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.
U.S. Secretary of State Baker declared himself "underwhelmed" by the offer, but softening of the Soviet position was a welcome sign appropriate to the occasion.
