In August 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida, and Louisiana leaving 19 dead and extensive property damage.
In Florida a quarter of a million were left homeless.
The cost to insurers, concentrated in U.S. companies, was estimated as high as $20 billion and much of the damaged property was not insured.
Federal authorities promised emergency aid after Florida officials complained of delays in supplying food and water.
The cost of rebuilding Florida and caring for those displaced by the storm was estimated at $20-$30 billion.
Fortunately the storm did not hit low-lying New Orleans or oil facilities along the gulf coast.
