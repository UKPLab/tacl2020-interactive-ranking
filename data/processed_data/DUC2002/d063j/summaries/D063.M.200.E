A barracks at the Royal Marine Music School in Deal was leveled in an explosion on Friday, which killed 10 persons and injured 22 others, 12 seriously.
Responsibility for the blast was claimed by the Irish Republican Army, which said the attack was in response to a recent speech made by Prime Minister Thatcher to the Ulster Defense Regiment.
Calling the speech an "act of war," the IRA said such attacks would continue until the British withdrew their forces from Northern Ireland and allow a unification of the protestant Northern Ireland with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
The explosion, which could be heard two miles away, came at 8:30 in the morning, just as the musicians were taking a coffee break.
Destroying the barracks, it also severely damaged a number of neighborhood homes, causing minor injuries among their residents.
Neighbors of the barracks as well as opposition politicians blamed the use of private security firms, which, they say, caused the security at the base to be lax.
Defending the use of the firms, Defense Secretary Tome King issued an alert for all military bases in Britain.
The attack is the latest in a series of deadly attacks against British bases in the last 20 years.
