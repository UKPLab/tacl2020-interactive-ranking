An estimated $20 billion dollars in damage caused by Hurricane Andrew could generate up to $7.3 billion in claims, making this the costliest year ever for the US property- casualty industry.
Most damage occurred in south Florida.
Very little of the loss is covered by foreign reinsurers.
Government relief efforts are underway.
