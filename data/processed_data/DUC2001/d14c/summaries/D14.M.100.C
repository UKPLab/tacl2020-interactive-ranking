Aircraft crashes between June 1988 and October 1990 destroyed planes of the United States Air Force, Navy and Marines.
Individual crashes occurred on three continents, over oceans and on an aircraft carrier.
No accident was caused by enemy action, but several occurred when activity was at a high level in preparation for combat.
Attack aircraft, fighters, helicopters, a bomber, a transport, and a trainer were lost.
Some accidents claimed no lives; one caused 13 deaths.
Some aircraft fell in isolated areas; one tore through a heavily populated area.
