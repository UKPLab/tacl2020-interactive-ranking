A review of data concerning crashes of United States military aircraft that occurred between June 1998 and October 1990 reveals that the subject crashes took place in many parts of the world and under widely varying circumstances.
The list of accidents is by no means complete, but it is representative.
Accidents befell aircraft of the United States Air Force, the Navy and the Marines.
A huge transport, a bomber that has been the backbone of the force, attack jets, air-to-air fighters, a training plane and helicopters suffered accidents during the period.
Aircraft accidents occurred over oceans, aboard a carrier, in the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany and Saudi Arabia.
The United States was at peace throughout the period, and no accident was the result of enemy action.
However, by the end of the period, after August 1990 there were accidents during Operation Desert Shield when the United States was building up its forces in the Persian Gulf.
The greatest loss of life in a single accident on August 29, 1990 when a C-5 transport crashed near Ramstein in West Germany, killing 13 of the 17 aboard the plane.
Nine of the 13 dead were reservists who had volunteered for Operation Desert Shield.
The crash that caused the most serious backlash also occurred in Germany when a United States A-10 attack plane killed seven Germans while cutting a swath of destruction through a populated area.
This crash followed upon earlier crashes of NATO aircraft caused German protests, and prompted German officials to worry publicly about an adverse affect on defense issues.
A concise listing of the crashes not specifically mentioned above follows.
In 1988 two Air Force F-16s collided in air south of Mainz in Germany, and a single F-16 crashed in Northern Japan, and two Navy F-14 fighters crashed in the United States, and an Air Force B-52 bomber crashed in Michigan, and finally, an A-10 Thunderbolt went down in Britain.
In 1989 the only aircraft accident reported was that involving a Navy trainer on the carrier Lexington.
In October 1990 an Air Force F-111, an Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet, an Air Force F-15E, and two Marine UH-1 helicopters went down.
Those heavy losses caused the Pentagon to suspend training for 24 hours.
