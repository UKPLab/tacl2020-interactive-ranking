Despite changes in its leadership and a revamping of its policies, the World Bank has yet to reduce the burgeoning Third World debt, one of its stated goals.
There are a number of views on how this should be accomplished.
One view is to by-pass the governments of developing countries and invest directly in the private sector.
Another view is to follow conservative fiscal policies of lending new money and not to reduce any debt.
Some bank managers want to see political strings attached to World Bank loans.
One problem that persists in the lending of funds to the Third World by the World Bank: the loan of new money often results in swamping the receiving countries with interest payments.
The total received by the World Bank sometimes amounts to more than it lends in loans.
Brazil, the heaviest debtor nation, blames the industrial nations for the poverty of developing nations.
As if in answer to Brazil's problems, the Bank of Boston has begun a policy of writing-off its loans to the third world as uncollectible.
This policy however, may inhibit any new loans to the Third World.
Lord Bauer of the House of Lords, British Parliament, voiced his objection to a recent "Letter to the Editor" of the Wall Street Journal.
He defended the efforts of the World Bank to alleviate debt in the Third World.
Bauer emphasized that the loans do not increase with inflation and are often canceled or rescheduled.
Bauer also believes that Africa's poverty is domestically-caused by some Third World governments' policies.
A new concept in getting funds to the poor is that developed by John Hatch.
His idea, called "village banking," is a means of investment using small loans to poor women at low interest to finance their own private enterprise.
The village banking idea has grown in nine countries and the loans are nearly 100 percent repaid.
Third World banks and large development organizations are now participating in "microloans."
It is a guarantee for repayment because the recipients want to earn a favorable credit rating.
The plus factor is that it eliminates loan sharks.
The World Bank may be getting more on track according to a recent statement by its president.
The bank will reward any Third World government with larger loans for a stronger commitment on poverty reduction.
Conversely, he stated that a weaker commitment to poverty reduction will warrant less support.
