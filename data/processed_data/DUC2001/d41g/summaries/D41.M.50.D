Last year the U.S. Forest service said 5 million acres were charred in raging wildfires including 706,000 Acres in Yellowstone National Park.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires.
Other hard hit areas included Alaska, California, Montana and Idaho.
Foresters are waiting to see where and when the fires will start this season.
