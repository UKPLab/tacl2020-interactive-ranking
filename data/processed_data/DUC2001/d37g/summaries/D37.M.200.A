Assassinations covered in selected news reports 1988-1994 seemed to fall into three categories: those motivated by internal political rivalries; those committed by inimical ethnic or religious forces; and those connected with drug trafficking.
The first category was best represented by numerous assassinations carried out in the Philippines by the New People's Army, a rebel group attempting to overthrow the Philippine government.
The victims appeared to be any soldier or policeman who presented himself as a target of opportunity.
The 1979 assassination of the President of South Korea by another contender for power also belongs in the internal political grouping.
The second category covers a series of assassinations involving the conflict between Jewish Israel and its Moslem enemies and the struggle between the different factions of Islam.
The assassinations in India of Indira Gandhi by Sikh militants and of Rajiv Gandhi by Tamil separatists also belong in this second class.
The third category is filled with slayings of prominent political figures in Colombia and Mexico who threatened in one way or another to alter the status quo and thus presented a challenge to the livelihood of powerful drug cartels.
