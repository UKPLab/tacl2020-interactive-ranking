Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains of Peru and claimed to be defenders of impoverished Peruvian coca farmers, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in the makeshift communities near the capital where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people live.
The rebels made a move into the shantytowns that encircle the country's capital.
The Maoist followers of the movement, once secretive fanatics, made a purposeful shift into a more public role that has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
From their Andean base in the province of Ayacucho, the guerrillas demand that farmers pay for protection from anti-drug police with one-fifth of their coca crop.
They also banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley.
Though a number of top Shining Path leaders were arrested by authorities, the Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members who remain free, decided to continue the "people's war."
The committee criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating to end the hostilities against the Peruvian government.
However, jailed leaders drew up their own peace proposal agreement with the government.
The 10-point agreement said its main goal was to "stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and propaganda."
The validity of that agreement was later challenged by Shining Path members who had broken with the jailed insurgents.
In a statement made during a television interview in Peru, subversion specialist Carlos Tapia said he believed the Shining Path did not intend to seek reconciliation in the country, had disarmed itself neither militarily nor ideologically, and was instead trying to become a semi-legal political party operating as a shock force against the opposition.
When Alberto Fujimori took over as Peru's president, there was speculation as to whether the Shining Path guerrilla movement would hound his administration as it had the previous two.
At the time of Fujimori's inauguration, there was strong disagreement among Shining Path watchers on a number of fundamental questions.
Was the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker?
Was it making progress or losing ground among the population?
And finally, who was actually winning the war?
