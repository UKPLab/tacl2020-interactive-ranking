The Shining Path is a Maoist splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party and was founded in 1970 by Abimael Guzman, a Marxist philosophy professor.
This group sought to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state.
It first concentrated on semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the Andean highlands, gaining support from Indians long persecuted by the ruling elite, who are ethnic Europeans.
In 1980, the group took up arms and began guerrilla operations.
In the mid-1980's, the guerrillas began to move into the jungles of the Upper Huallaga Valley.
There, they gained support among the coca farmers.
Although they demanded one-fifth of the farmer's crop, the Shining Path guerrillas provided protection from the abuses and corruption of the police and anti-drug operations.
Having a reputation for almost puritanical honesty, they brought their own brand of law and order to the region, killing those who disobeyed.
By 1988, the government claimed the fighting had taken 15,000 lives and caused $10 million in property damage.
In mid-1987, the guerrillas began taking a more public role in the shantytowns surrounding Lima.
They became involved with labor unions and student groups and published at newspaper "El Diario."
By 1990, according to Peru's President Garcia, the People's Defense Revolutionary Movement had been formed to operate in Lima and other coastal urban areas.
Violence occurred in Lima preceding the July 28, 1990 presidential run-off election between Mario Vargas Llosa and Alberto Fujimori.
Peruvian presidents had not been successful in handling the Shining Path.
Belaunde had ignored the guerrillas.
Garcia had first tried a liberal approach, then a get-tough approach, then hoped simply to coexist.
While Fujimori had campaigned advocating economic-development initiatives, his actual policies were quite different.
By 1994, many leaders of the group, including Guzman, were in jail.
A faction of free guerrillas led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," had formed and was beginning to assert power.
According to a Peruvian subversion specialist, the government hoped to strengthen Guzman's position, allowing him to organize a second party congress from jail, which would recommend disarmament and the end of violence.
A 10-point agreement that would stop the fighting, dismantle the guerrilla army, allow exiled members to return, and permit a gradual general amnesty was rumored to exist.
In February 1994, the Shining Path Central Committee, presided over by Feliciano and comprised of leaders who had not been arrested, repudiated any peace overtures and their advocates.
The committee called for continuation of the people's war, even in the cities.
