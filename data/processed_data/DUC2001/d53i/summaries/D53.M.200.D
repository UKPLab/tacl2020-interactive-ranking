Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains of Peru and claimed to be defenders of impoverished Peruvian coca farmers, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in the makeshift communities near the capital where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people live.
From their Andean base in the province of Ayacucho, the guerrillas demand that farmers pay for protection from anti-drug police with one-fifth of their coca crop.
They also banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley.
Though a number of top Shining Path leaders were arrested by authorities, the Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members who remain free, decided to continue the "people's war."
Jailed leaders drew up their own peace proposal agreement with the government, vowing to stop terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and propaganda.
When Alberto Fujimori took over as Peru's president, there was speculation as to whether the Shining Path guerrilla movement would hound his administration.
