The Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, sought to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state.
It was successful among the Indians in the Andes and extended guerrilla warfare to the jungles and cities.
By 1994, however, many leaders were jailed and a second faction formed.
