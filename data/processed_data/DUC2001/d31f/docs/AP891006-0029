Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked off track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids, says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
``I got caught in Seoul.
I lost my gold medal,'' the Canadian told reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as a controlled substance was introduced Thursday.
``I'm here to tell the people of this country it's wrong to cheat, not to take it, it's bad for your health.''
Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man who was awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost.
``I think it's great,'' Lewis said of the legislation.
``They're making a move and it's very positive.
I'm happy to see it.''
However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: ``I don't understand why Ben Johnson's here.''
Lewis said he attended the news conference because he was working on his autobiography and one of the chapters deals with steroids.
He said he didn't intend to upstage Johnson.
Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented the legislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlled substance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids by college, high school and even junior high school athletes who believe the substance will enhance their performance.
``America is about to have an adolescent time-bomb explode in its hands,'' Levine said.
``But if we act quickly enough to restrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties for illicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.''
Levine referred to the abuse of steroids as ``the silent side of the drug disease in this country.''
He applauded Johnson's courage for attending the news conference.
Johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voice with a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the same mistake he did, urging them ``to come forward, to come clean.''
Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids, indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson ``if he comes back and he's clean.''
While Lewis held the spotlight, Johnson slipped away to adjoining congressional offices.
``He's not here to compete with Carl Lewis.
I hope he will someday,'' said Ed Futerman, Johnson's lawyer.
