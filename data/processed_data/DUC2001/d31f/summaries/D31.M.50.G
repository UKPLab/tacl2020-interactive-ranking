Canadian Ben Johnson won the 100-meter dash at the 1988 Olympics but was stripped of his medal when he tested positive for illegal steroid use.
A teammate said Johnson's physician had provided steroids to her and Johnson with their coach's knowledge.
In 1991, the coach admitted giving his team illegal steroids.
