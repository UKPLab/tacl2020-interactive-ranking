Ben Johnson, who came to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old, at 26 won an Olympic gold medal for the 100-meter dash in a record-breaking 9.79 seconds in Seoul on September 24, 1988.
He forfeited it when his after-race urine sample, mandatory for Olympic winners, proved positive for the illegal anabolic muscle-building steroid Stanozolol.
He was also automatically suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life.
His Olympic world-record time was revoked.
The gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who suspected Johnson took drugs at the Olympics because he came out of the blocks like a caged lion after looking tired in qualifying heats.
Johnson denied any drug use and was backed by his family, sister Clare Rodney and mother Gloria in Toronto and father Ben Johnson Sr. in Falmouth, Jamaica.
Sports Minister Jean Charest heard rumors of Johnson's steroid use but tests were always negative.
Teammate Angella Issajenko said physician Dr. George (Jamie) Astaphan provided steroids to both her and Johnson with the knowledge of their coach Charlie Francis.
Astaphan later said Johnson took a banned steroid once in May 1988 when he was depressed by a hamstring injury.
Francis originally suggested sabotage of the sample by someone connected with opponent Carl Lewis, but in March 1989 testified Johnson had taken Furazabol, Stanozolol and the human growth hormone since 1981.
He estimated steroids made Johnson faster by one meter.
Johnson testified in June 1989 he had taken illegal performance-enhancing drugs for seven years and began speaking out against drug use by athletes.
In September 1989 the IAAF adopted the Ben Johnson Rule, allowing it to decertify results if athletes were later shown to have used a banned substance before performances.
Johnson's results from 1983 to 1989 were erased, including his record 9.83 in the 100 meters at the 1987 World Championships in Rome, although his after-race test was negative.
In 1990 Johnson was training to regain his form.
His upper body was less bulky and his face less puffy, but he still weighed 174 pounds and was bench-pressing 365.
He returned to competition in The Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games on January 11, 1991, where he came in second.
Coach Francis was replaced by Loren Seagrave.
Close associates were Jamaican-born Toronto businessman Kameel Azan, attorney Ed Futerman, and agent Larry Heidebrecht.
Johnson was receiving high appearance fees and giving interviews only for pay.
