At the Seoul Olympics in September 1988, Canadian Ben Johnson won the 100-meter dash in 9.79 seconds but was stripped of his gold medal after a test showed he had used an illegal anabolic steroid called stanzolol.
He was also suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life.
The medal went to America's Carl Lewis.
Hundreds of Canadians supported him but most felt shocked and shamed by the incident.
In a published interview, a fellow Canadian sprinter, Angella Issajenko, said that Johnson had knowingly taken steroids.
She claimed that Dr. Jamie Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, provided the steroids to her and Johnson with the knowledge of their track coach.
The federal government called for a judicial inquiry into the Johnson affair.
Dr. Astaphan said Johnson had taken stanzolol four months before the Olympics and suffered muscle spasms from it, but was not on stanzolol when he beat Lewis.
He denied he had ever prescribed such drugs to any athletes.
In mid- June 1989, Johnson testified that his involvement with illegal performance enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome.
Carl Lewis was implicated in alleged sabotage to Johnson's drug test.
Accordingly, testimony at a Canadian inquiry suggested that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer inasmuch as Lewis had been talking to a man who sat near the beer provided to facilitate urine sample.
Linda Huey, an NBC-TV employee and a physical therapist at the Seoul Olympics, said that Canadian coach, Charlie Francis, claimed that Johnson's urine sample was spiked with a banned steroid and before the race said Johnson was "more afraid of failing the drug test than he is of Carl Lewis."
At a news conference in October 1989, called after legislation to classify anabolic steroids as a controlled substance was introduced, Johnson said it was wrong for athletes to use muscle-building substances.
By September 1990, Johnson's two-year suspension had ended.
Track meet promoters were eager to sign him up, hoping to fill seats and rejuvenate interest in track.
He ran in a track meet in Hamilton, Canada, where he finished second in the 50-meter dash, short of his record time, but received a standing ovation.
In 1991, the Canadian coach, Charlie Francis, testified at a federal inquiry that he had given athletes every steroid combination imaginable.
His system worked well until Johnson tested positive for illegal steroid use at Seoul.
