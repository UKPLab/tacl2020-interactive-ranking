On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11.3 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
Cleanup of the disaster continued until September and cost almost $2 billion, but 117 miles of beach remained oily.
Exxon announced an earnings- drop in January 1990 and was ordered to resume cleaning on May 1.
