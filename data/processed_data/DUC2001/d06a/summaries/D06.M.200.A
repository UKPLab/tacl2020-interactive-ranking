There were many reported cases of "police brutality" or excessive use of force by police officers during the years 1989-1992.
The most famous was the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by four Los Angeles officers on March 3, 1991.
The report of the Christopher Commission, formed to investigate the King case, focused national attention on the problems of law enforcement and proposed steps to solve these problems.
It also called for the resignation of the Police Chief, Daryl Gates, who refused to resign until June 1992 after the acquittal of the four policemen caused massive rioting.
Other cases of police brutality against blacks and Hispanics came to light elsewhere in southern California as well as in Minneapolis, Chicago, and Kansas City, MO.
Another source of charges of police brutality was Operation Rescue (OR), an organization that conducted anti-abortion demonstrations.
OR maintained that police tactics employed in more than 50 cities amounted to torture and had resulted in serious injuries to non-violent demonstrators arrested by police.
Complaints specifically mentioned Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, San Diego, West Hartford, Conn., and Boston.
Congress passed and on November 15, 1989 President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police used excessive force.
