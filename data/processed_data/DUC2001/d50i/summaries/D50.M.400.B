In 1988, the United States experienced one of the worst droughts of this century.
Protracted dry weather expanded eastward from the Rockies into the Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and into the Mid-Atlantic region.
It severely hurt, and in some places crippled, what started as one of the most optimistic farm years in the last eight.
In early July, the weather service reported that 29 percent of the nation was undergoing drought conditions.
It was about equivalent to the drought experienced in 1911, but less severe than those of the 1930s or 1956.
However, in the Midwest, large areas have suffered the driest April-June period since 1895.
The Agriculture Department constantly monitored the situation.
It set up hotlines for worried callers and began issuing informational statements.
The first statement listed 22 drought related actions taken by the USDA.
However, only two of them involved the expenditure of funds, which went for meat purchases for school cafeterias and a credit arrangement for Mexico to buy meat.
These purchases helped livestock markets, which were depressed due to drought-induced liquidation of herds.
Affected counties were allowed to conduct emergency haying and grazing of Acreage Conservation Reserve (ACR) land and Conservation Use Acreage (CUA) land.
Later, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land was also opened.
As conditions got worse, Congress passed a record $3.9 billion drought relief bill.
Being an election year, the bill, originally intended only for drought relief, was broadened to include floods, heat, insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus.
Thousands of farmers throughout the country received an unexpected windfall by collecting millions for what previously had been considered normal quirks of nature.
In spite of these misappropriations, the program really did help those who needed it most.
North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state, received $410.2 million, about 10.5 percent of the total package.
The money not only helped more than 49,000 farmers in the state, but the trickle-down effect of payments reduced statewide losses to farm dependent businesses, banks and households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion.
North Dakota, along with Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin received nearly half of the allocated aid.
Certain weather researchers believe the drought was caused by temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific, which forced the jet stream to shift northward.
If this is true, and such weather abnormalities can be predicted, then perhaps we can one day also anticipate impending droughts.
