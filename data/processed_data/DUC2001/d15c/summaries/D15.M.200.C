Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease.
Its morbidity rate was declining from the 1950s until the early 1980s.
The trend was then reversed and by the mid-1980s it was increasing rapidly.
By 1990 it was killing three million a year, and was identified as the world's deadliest infectious disease.
The incidence of tuberculosis varies widely from area to area.
It was running rampant in sub-Saharan Africa, and was increasing in Latin America and Southeast Asia.
In 1989, within the United States, there was an increase of five percent over the previous year.
Wyoming reported no new cases, but New Jersey had an increase of 35 percent.
The AIDS connection is the single most important factor in the tuberculosis epidemic.
This is true everywhere, but especially so in Africa where AIDS is unchecked.
Millions of people carry the latent tuberculosis bacterium in their bodies and never become ill unless their immune systems lose the capability to fight off the disease.
This happens to AIDS patients.
They develop tuberculosis, and unlike AIDS, it is easily transmitted through the air.
Prisoners are three times more likely to have tuberculosis than are non-prisoners.
Modern airtight office buildings, housing large staffs and often providing poor ventilation, are sources of tuberculosis.
