The steady decline in tuberculosis (TB) had almost stopped by 1990.
TB is a highly contagious, bacterial lung disease, which is spread by airborne particles.
As many as 7% of Americans (an estimated 10 million in 1990) are infected with the bacteria, but only about 10% ever actually develop an active infection.
TB is preventable and curable, but when it is not treated 50% of the victims die within 2 years.
At-risk people need preventative medication and active cases must be diagnosed.
The 6-month treatment protocol costs between $30 and $50, but is not readily available in developing countries.
According to the World Health Organization in 1990, TB was the world's deadliest infectious disease, killing 3 million people annually worldwide.
In 1993, morbidity and mortality from TB increased in Latvia.
The increase in TB cases in the U.S. seems to be attributed to the rise in the number of people infected with HIV, the AIDS virus.
Infected early in life, these people fought off the TB bacteria until HIV compromised their immune system.
Increases in TB cases also have been seen in prisons.
A 1989 survey revealed 31 TB cases per 100,000 prisoners, while there were 8 cases per 100,000 non-prisoners.
Also at higher risk are homeless people, others with poor nutrition, and those with serious illnesses.
Poor ventilation systems in modern office buildings have even been identified with increasing the spread of TB and other infectious diseases.
One 1990 study of nursing home patients in Arkansas determined that blacks were twice as likely as whites to become infected with TB, even while living under the same conditions.
This may suggest that whites have evolved with a better resistance.
In the U.S. in 1988, TB rates were 4.1 per 100,000 whites, 28.3 per 100,000 blacks, 18.3 per 100,000 Hispanics, and 36.3 per 100,000 Asians and Pacific Americans.
Within the United States, aggressive measures where TB risks are higher were called for.
The Center of Disease Control recommended that prisons test for TB, administer chest X- rays, and isolate victims.
Training in TB prevention and control is needed for staffs at homeless centers, substance abuse centers, and HIV clinics.
Homeless should be tested and victims placed in residences.
The preventative drug isoniazid can be administered in drug treatment centers along with the methadone.
For modern office buildings adding 35 cubic feet of outdoor air per minute is recommended, although expensive.
