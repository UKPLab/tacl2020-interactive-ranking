Tuberculosis increased rapidly during the 1980s and by 1990 was the world's deadliest infectious disease.
AIDS sufferers, with their damaged immune systems, developed tuberculosis in great numbers and transmitted it to others.
Tuberculosis was especially prevalent in poorer countries.
In the United States, it was most often seen in the northeastern states.
