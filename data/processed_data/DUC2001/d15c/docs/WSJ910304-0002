The health department said it is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control.
The department also has an established residence for homeless tuberculosis patients, and is working with substance-abuse treatment services to extend tuberculosis prevention in its programs.
The Board of Health approved a resolution last year requiring all children entering city schools to be tested.

But only a fraction of a percent of those who have active tuberculosis disease can spread the infection to susceptible individuals.
The germ is inactive in more than 99% of those infected.
Those at high risk for contracting TB are people whose capacity for resisting infection is weakened, either through diseases such as HIV infection, by drug or alcohol abuse, serious illness such as cancer, or by poor nutrition.
The greatest concentration of tuberculosis was in the 25-to-44 age group, accounting for 57% of the total.
