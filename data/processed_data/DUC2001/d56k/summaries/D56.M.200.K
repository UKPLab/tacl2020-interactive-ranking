Twelve million Americans have diabetes, but minorities are hardest hit.
14-21% of Hispanics and up to 40% of minority seniors may become victims, usually of Type II Adult onset diabetes.
Texas and California, with high Hispanic populations, are especially vulnerable.
In San Antonio, (40% Hispanic) a research center operates at the University of Texas Health Center, focusing on finding a gene that may lead to a screening test.
They also send teams out to the local neighborhoods to test for diabetes and educate the population.
Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diet of fried foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention are the root causes of their predisposition.
California, with its high Hispanic population, is also active in the struggle, led by the Diabetes Society.
They focus on prevention of obesity; teaching clients healthy diet and exercise habits, and the symptoms, treatment and complications of diabetes.
They have learned that cultural tendencies are highly important factors in this work.
Meanwhile, researchers are working to find new treatments and tests for diabetes.
One hope is the discovery of amylin, a hormone found only in diabetics' pancreases.
Symptoms include increased hunger, thirst and urination, with weight loss.
