In 1989, it was reported that twelve million Americans had some form of diabetes; over 150,000 died yearly from diabetes; another 150,000 died from diabetes-related illness.
Diabetes is a defect in the body's system for using sugar in the blood.
It results from the body's failure to make insulin.
The most common form of the disease is Type II diabetes.
A study begun in 1988 indicated that the hormone "amylin", found in the pancreases of diabetes, might be responsible for reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetics.
Research in San Antonio, 50 percent Hispanic, has shown that poor Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes than the general population; namely, because of their diet of cheap processed, high-calorie foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention.
Researchers there were testing an anti-diabetic drug, metaforim, used successfully outside the US.
In San Jose and Santa Clara, California, health officials, encouraged by Americans' success with lowering heart disease, set up clinics and programs to educate Hispanics on the dangers of diabetes and how to manage illness.
Students were given instructions, geared to Hispanic lifestyle, on cooking with polyunsaturated oil instead of lard and on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise.
