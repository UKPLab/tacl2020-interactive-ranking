i During the period 1988-1991 there were some hopeful developments in diabetes research and some progress in educating the public on causes and means of preventing or containing the disease.
The hormone amylin was identified as a causative agent in reduced insulin secretion and reduced effectiveness of insulin in diabetics.
An anti-diabetic drug called metaforim was also being tested.
At the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio studies were under way of diabetes in Hispanic families.
Hispanics are three times more likely to develop diabetes than the general population and researchers hope to identify the gene that triggers the disease.
The center also noted that lower- income Mexican Americans have a higher rate of diabetes than those of higher income, suggesting that diet and lifestyle are factors.
The center encouraged programs to educate school-age children about the importance of healthy diets and exercise.
After the failure of several campaigns directed at California Hispanics, a breakthrough in educational approach occurred in the San Jose area in the summer of 1991.
Free nutrition and exercise classes expressly targeting the Hispanic lifestyle were offered.
Instructors were bilingual and the nutritional aspects emphasized preparation of traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than lard.
