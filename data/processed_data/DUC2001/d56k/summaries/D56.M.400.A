Although there were no dramatic breakthroughs in the treatment of diabetes during the period 1988-1991 there were some hopeful developments in research and progress in educating the public as to steps that can be taken to prevent the disease or to contain it after its onset.
On the research side, in November 1988 Garth Cooper, a New Zealand biochemist, announced that a newly isolated hormone may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease.
The hormone amylin is normally undetectable but is found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics and appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes.
In 1989 researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas were working on an anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that seemed to improve the body's ability to respond to insulin.
At the same center studies of diabetes in Hispanic families were being conducted.
Hispanics are three times more likely to develop diabetes than the general population and researchers hoped they would eventually find the gene that triggers the disease.
Studies at the San Antonio center showed that although Hispanics may have a genetic predisposition to diabetes, diet and lifestyle contribute to contraction of the disease.
Lower-income Mexican Americans had a higher rate of diabetes than those of higher income suggesting that diets of cheap, processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention were factors.
The researchers encouraged programs to educate school-age children about the importance of healthy diets and exercise.
The American Diabetes Association and other health education groups in California took up the challenge.
As early as 1984 there were attempts to promote healthier diets and regular exercise among Hispanics, but the programs seemed to make little headway.
In 1989 it was estimated that by the year 2000 the number of Hispanic diabetics in the U.S. would reach 8 million at a health-care cost of $10 billion a year.
In the summer of 1991 health professionals in the San Jose area opened free nutrition and exercise classes that expressly targeted the Hispanic lifestyle and emphasized preparation of traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than recipes that call for lard.
For the first time the classes were taught by bilingual instructors who could reach the monolingual Spanish-speaker.
