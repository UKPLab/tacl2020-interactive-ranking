The 31-mile tunnel, called the "chunnel" links Calais and Folkestone.
It was scheduled to open in May 1994.
The arduous construction work that started in 1987 cost over 16 billion dollars, and resulted in nine deaths.
The construction was financed by private capital, and was directed by a consortium of British and French companies.
Contrary to the prevailing sentiment in France, the English were much opposed to the "chunnel".
They regard it as a threat to their island identity.
The "chunnel" will cut rail ravel time between London and Paris to three and one-half hours.
