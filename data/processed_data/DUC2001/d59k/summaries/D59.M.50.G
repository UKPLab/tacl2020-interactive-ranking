From August 1987 through March 1991, several airline incidents caused a high death toll.
Crashes in Detroit, Albuquerque, Iowa, Ethiopia, Mississippi, and Colorado killed 154, 5, 123, 16, 2 and 25, respectively.
Also, a jetliner explosion over Scotland killed 181 and another over Niger killed 171--both apparently terrorist acts.
