Following is a random survey of some of the plane crashes that occurred from 1987 to 1991.
1.
A Northwest Airlines MD-82 crashed on takeoff August 16, 1987 in Detroit.
Engine failure was a likely cause and 154 people died; one child survived.
2.
On May 7, 1988, a single-engine Cessna crashed in the outskirts of Albuquerque, New Mexico in rain and wind, killing four adults and one child.
The pilot aborted the first landing attempt and crashed while making a second try.
3.
On a flight from London to Belfast, a Boeing 737 crash-landed at East Midlands Airport.
It appeared that the left engine had caught fire but the pilot shut down the right engine in error.
The resulting crash killed 49 people and injured 82, including the pilot.
4.
Pan American flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland and crashed on December 22, 1988, killing all 259 aboard and 22 others on the ground.
Warnings of a terrorist plot to bomb a Pan Am flight had been received prior to the incident.
5.
On July 20, 1989, a United Airlines pilot tried valiantly to bring a DC-10 airliner under control after a rare complete hydraulic failure.
The cause may have been an engine explosion in which debris damaged a duct common to all three hydraulic systems.
The plane crash-landed into a cornfield in Iowa.
Casualties included 127 killed but 166 survived as the plane broke apart, then exploded and burned.
Some passengers walked away unharmed.

7.
A French UTA DC-10 jetliner crashed into the desert of Niger, Northern Africa, killing all 171 aboard, including the wife of the American Ambassador to Chad.
The plane exploded in midair; a terrorist plot is suspected.
8.
On March 4, 1991, a United Airlines 737 crashed into a dry lake near the Colorado Springs, Colorado, airport.
Twenty passengers and a crew of five were killed when the plane nose-dived to earth, probably due to wind shear.
