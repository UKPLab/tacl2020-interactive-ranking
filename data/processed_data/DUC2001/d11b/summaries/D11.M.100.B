Tornadoes, most prevalent in April through June, are generally found in the south and the nation's heartland states, but can occur elsewhere.
Tornadoes, on average, are about 25 yards wide and travel about two miles on the ground at a speed of 30 mph.
Violent tornadoes, with wind speeds more than 200 mph and a path averaging 26 miles, will cut a swath of death and destruction as experienced in Huntsville, Alabama in November 1989.
Meteorologists attribute the decline in tornado-related deaths to greater public awareness, such as knowing the difference between a tornado "watch" and "warning" and taking proper shelter.
