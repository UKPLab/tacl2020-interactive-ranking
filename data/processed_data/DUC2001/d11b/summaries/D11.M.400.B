Rambling spring thunderstorms announce the unofficial tornado season that runs from April through June across Texas and other states in the nation's heartland.
Few during winter months, National Climatic Data Center records indicate tornado occurrences begin to increase sharply in March, reaching an annual April average of 109, peaking at a May average of 166, and then tapering off to an average of 150 in June.
Here are some facts.
The portion of a thunderstorm adjacent to large hail is where tornadoes are most likely to occur, frequently between 3 and 6 p.m.
Most track southwest to northeast, but their paths can spiral erratically.
The typical tornado is about 50 yards wide and travels about two miles on the ground.
Tornadoes travel at an average speed of 30 mph, but can stand still or go 70 mph.
The longest tornado on record, in March 1925, went 219 miles across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.
Less than two percent of tornadoes are classified as violent.
On average, there are 99 tornado-related deaths per year, but this average has been declining.
The largest single outbreak of twisters on record occurred in April 1974 when 148 storms killed 300 people in 13 states over a two-day period.
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita, an American professor of geophysical science, is one of the world's leading authorities on tornadoes.
He discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters called suction vortices rotating around the center of a larger tornado.
He developed the "Fujita Scale" for measuring the strength of tornadoes.
It runs from zero - a tornado that might break twigs on trees, to five - a twister that can rip houses from their foundations.
One of the strongest tornadoes in recent years occurred in Huntsville, Alabama in November 1989.
It carved a three-mile stretch of devastation, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and leaving 1,000 homeless.
Knowing a few simple rules can save lives.
A tornado watch means that conditions are suitable for a tornado to develop.
A tornado warning means that one has already been spotted.
Plan what you'll do if caught in a tornado.
If at home, go to the basement or to the center of the house away from windows.
If in a car, do not try to outrun the tornado.
Take cover in the nearest ditch or depression.
Flying debris causes most fatalities.
