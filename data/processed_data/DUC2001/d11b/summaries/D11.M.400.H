Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds, occur as winter transitions to spring.
Hot weather stirs the air and helps form thunderstorms.
Tornadoes increase in March and are most common in May and June but can occur any month.
The November average is 23 storms, but in 1988, unusually warm, wet November weather triggered 121; and on November 15, 1989, tornadoes were reported in 13 states and killed at least 27, including 17 in Huntsville, Alabama.
Tornadoes are most frequent between 3 and 6pm and least likely just before sunrise, although an April 1988 tornado hit Madison, Florida, at 4:30am and killed four.
The typical tornado is 50 yards wide, heads northeast at an average speed of 30 mph, and travels two miles on the ground.
Single large thunderstorms are likelier to produce tornadoes than groups of storms which compete to rotate.
Most strong tornadoes are actually 6-7 small ones rotating around a larger tornado's center.
Tornadoes are most likely to occur in the thunderstorm portion adjacent to large hail.
Tornadoes are impossible to redirect or squelch.
They tend to concentrate in regions for 5-6 years.
Less than 2% of tornadoes are classified violent.
The longest on record went 219 miles in March 1925.
The largest single outbreak was in April 1974 when 148 killed 300 people in 13 states over two days.
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita has studied tornadoes for 42 years and creates miniature tornadoes in his lab.
A bottom fan makes a swirling motion and a top fan simulates a low- pressure system's updraft.
His Fujita Scale ranks tornado strength, with zero meaning breaking twigs and five meaning ripping up houses.
1990, one of the worst years for tornadoes, saw at least 726 in the first six months, including a March tornado reaching 300 mph, and 101 touching down the first weekend in June.
Tornado deaths are decreasing with greater public awareness and better warning.
Computers now make many sources of data accessible and the national weather service provides continual updates.
A tornado watch means conditions are suitable for development of tornadoes.
A warning means one has already developed.
In case of a tornado, people should go underground or to a central part of a building, squat or lie flat, and cover their heads, since most fatalities are from flying debris.
If in a car or mobile home, they should get out and go to a safe shelter or a low area.
