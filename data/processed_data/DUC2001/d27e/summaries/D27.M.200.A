The passage of the Brady Bill in November 1993 did not end the debate over gun control in the United States Congress or in the country at large.
Gun-control advocates pointed to the proliferation of handguns and assault weapons and the high crime rates in the country.
The National Rifle Association continued to head up the campaign against any form of gun control and debate continued to center on the exact meaning of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
The Second Amendment states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."
Gun-control advocates say this means the federal government can not interfere with the states' right to maintain a militia.
Opponents say it is a guarantee of individuals' right to own and use weapons without interference from the government.
The Supreme Court has given no final answer to the question, but rulings in 1939 and earlier tend to support the advocates' interpretation.
As other gun-control measures are considered, the debate goes on with one side decrying firearms violence and the other defending unlimited access to weapons as a necessity for self-protection and a defense against tyranny.
