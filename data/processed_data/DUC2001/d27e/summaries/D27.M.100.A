Passage of the Brady Bill was a victory for advocates of gun control, but opponents, headed by the National Rifle Association, remain a potent force.
The debate continues; much of it is centered on the meaning of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Does it guarantee each individual's right to own and use firearms without interference from government or does it simply protect states' right to maintain a militia without interference from the federal government?
The Supreme Court has yet to give a final answer.
One side decries firearm violence while the other defends possession of guns for self-protection and defense against tyranny.
