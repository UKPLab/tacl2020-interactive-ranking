Total eclipses occur when the moon's shadow completely blocks out the sun.
Eclipses have been recorded as far back as 1200 years before Christ.
Total eclipses have a maximum duration of about seven minutes, and a single location will experience an eclipse at roughly 400-year intervals.
Eclipses awe viewers and provide opportunities for scientific discoveries.
A total eclipse occurred in 1988 over Indonesia and the Philippines, and another in 1990 over Finland and the Kola Peninsula.
An eclipse in 1991 was noteworthy for its duration and its visibility to large populations in Hawaii, Mexico and Brazil.
