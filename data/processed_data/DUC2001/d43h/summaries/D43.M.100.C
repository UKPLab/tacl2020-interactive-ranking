De Beers is a century-old South African company that produces and markets gem quality diamonds.
The company's marketing arm, the London-based Central Selling Organization, controls the selling of 80 percent of the world's gem quality diamonds by cleverly manipulating their supply and demand.
Uncut diamonds from Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola, Australia, Zaire and the Soviet Union are sold to dealers concentrated in Antwerp., New York, Tel Aviv and Bombay.
In recent years the countries selling through the CSO have aggressively sought more independence in selling their diamonds, but De Beers has successfully deflected those efforts.
