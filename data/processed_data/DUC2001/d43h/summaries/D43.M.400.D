Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving.
De Beers' Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York.
Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers' future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia.
World diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47 million carats in 1982.
The Opperheimer family empire face other concerns as well.
The black majority in South Africa threatens De Beers largely because of a newly energized political will.
The African National Congress has pledged to nationalize South Africa's major sources of wealth if it takes power.
Meanwhile in London, the Office of Trading is investigating the anti-competitive practices of De Beers.
Complaints suggest the De Beers have a monopoly on diamond trading in London.
The break-up of the former Soviet Union caused still another concern.
De Beers signed a five billion-dollar contract for uncut diamonds in 1990 with the former Soviet Union.
After a break-up of the Soviet Union the De Beers contract was continued with Rosalmazzoloto with hopes that the new government would work well with De Beers.
In Botswana some politicians want to change De Beers' exclusive sales contract so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the South African group's international cartel.
While a rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada are threatening the De Beers cartel.
In Canada's Northwest Territories where 81 small diamonds were found, prospectors are laying claim to every piece of land within 300km of the discovery.
In Angola, more than $1 million worth of diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
While De Beers have been faced with some uncertainly over the control of the uncut diamond market, other ventures are giving them more power.
Venetia is De Beers' newest diamond mine.
Last year the mine more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tons of ore to recover 4.96m carats.
The mine has revitalized De Beers' production and accounts for half the output in South Africa and replaces production from its 100-year-old Kimberley mines.
