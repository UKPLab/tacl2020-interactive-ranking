De Beers Consolidated Mines LTD was established in 1988.
The Oppenheimer family has controlled it since 1929.
It is a South African company that owns and operates diamond mines, and through its London-based Central Selling Organization, or CSO, markets its gem quality diamonds and those from Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola, Australia, Zaire and the Soviet Union.
Eighty percent of the world's gem quality diamonds are sold through the CSO to diamond dealers in Antwerp, New York, Tel Aviv and Bombay.
The 15 percent of the world's diamonds that are gems are prized for their show value, and their value fluctuates with the world's prosperity.
The United States is the biggest market, and Japan is second.
In 1992 De Beers opened a new diamond mine in South Africa.
Elsewhere they experienced varying problems between 1987 and 1994.
Dissolution of the Soviet Union caused problems.
In Britain the CSO was charged with monopolistic practices.
Angola unleashed a flood of illicitly mined and marketed diamonds.
Botswana wanted to sell more of its valuable diamonds independently.
There was a threat of nationalization in South Africa.
Despite all the problems De Beers was able to maintain control of the diamond market.
