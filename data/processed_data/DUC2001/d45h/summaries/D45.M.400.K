A Slovenian Chronology: May, 1988: It was confirmed that Yugoslavian military officials met in March to discuss dissidents in Slovenia.
The agreed-upon plan included arrest of dissidents and use of force in any resulting protests.
The military denied the plan, which was ultimately blocked by the Slovenian president.
December, 1989: Serbia cut economic and political ties with Slovenia after a banned pro- Serbian rally in Ljubljuana was dispersed.
Slovenia called Serbia's action a "declaration of war," while Serbia called for the resignation of Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene.
June,1990: Slovenia revealed preparation of a constitution allowing it full sovereignty within Yugoslavia.
Croatia joined its plan for a loose confederation.
The south, particularly Serbia, accused Slovenia of separatist tendencies while Slovenia charged Serbia with dominating Yugoslavia.
July 3, 1990: Slovenia's new government proclaimed sovereignty, declaring an independent legal system, control over armed forces stationed there, and the intention to create a new constitution, but stopped short of secession.
The new government, freely elected in June, announced its intention to join the European Union.
June, 1991: Slovenians declared independence from Yugoslavia.
Yugoslav troops battled militia for two days in Slovenia, surrounding Ljubljuana's airport.
Further south, Serbs fought Croatians.
Both countries vowed to defend independence.
July 1991: Slovenian spirits faltered as their stock market sunk, but they said there was no turning back.
August,1991: The European Community proposed a peace plan calling for negotiations with Yugoslavia.
A cease-fire was agreed upon on August 19, but failed the next day.
The plan's provision of a Croat's election to the presidency was blocked by Serbia, while the army, ordered to stand- down, continued to oppose Slovene militia.
The plan, devised by Prime Minister Marcovik and the European Community and accepted by Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, crumbled.
March, 1992: Independent Slovenia moved to settle relations with the Bank of Yugoslavia, establish foreign relations and join the IMF and World Bank.
May, 1992: With lowered production and exports and high unemployment, Slovenia sought new trading partners, although some foreign manufacturers continued to assemble products in Slovenia for later export.
March, 1993: Slovenia had progressed considerably.
Independent, they had achieved peace, privatisation and market reforms and no longer had to support Yugoslavia.
Their goal: a multi-party, market-oriented parliamentary democracy.
February, 1994: Rumors circulated that Slovenia had sent a delegation to Belgrade to work at normalization of relations with Yugoslavia, who denied the report.
Remaining issues are Yugoslavia's distrust of Slovenia and Slovenia's antipathy toward Serbia.
