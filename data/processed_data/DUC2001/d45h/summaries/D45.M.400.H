Economic decline caused increasing friction between liberal, rich Slovenia, the source of most of Yugoslavia's wealth, and hardline communist Serbia, as Slovenia watched the bloated, Serbian-dominated bureaucracy erode its finances.
Serbia vehemently opposed independence moves by Slovenia and Croatia, fearing loss of economic support.
In March 1988 federal military commanders planned to arrest Slovenian journalists and officials and crush subsequent protest demonstrations.
The plan was blocked after being reported by Slovenian security.
In December 1989 Slovenia banned a pro-Serbian rally in Lubljana and arrested 13 demonstrators, prompting Serbia to sever political and economic contact.
In June 1990 a Slovenian center-right coalition government, which had defeated reform communists, approved a plan for Slovenian sovereignty within a Yugoslav confederation.
It planned a democratic constitution and threatened to declare full independence if remaining republics did not agree to the confederation.
Croatia took similar action, prompted by recent Serbian crackdowns in Kosovo.
Fighting in Slovenia killed 40 after Serbian president Milosevic delayed the 1991 installation of a Croatian federal president.
Both sides prepared for further hostilities.
In mid-June an EC-brokered cease-fire called for installation of the president and a three- month delay in moves toward independence.
On June 25, 1991 Slovenia and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia.
In subsequent fighting, recently-formed Slovenian militia were outmatched by federal ground and air forces.
Following secession, EC countries hesitated to recognize Slovenian independence for fear of encouraging their own minorities, but Slovenia was determined to become a market-oriented, multi-party, parliamentary democracy.
In March 1992 Slovenian foreign exchange deposits still remained frozen by the National Bank of Yugoslavia.
Slovenia worked to establish new foreign credit and be recognized by the US in order to help improve its economic prospects and speed admission to the IMF and World Bank.
By May 1992 Slovenian unemployment rose as industrial production dropped, but a strong monetary policy kept inflation under control.
Slovenia signed trade agreements with Croatia and Macedonia, sought new markets among EC countries to replace the large Yugoslav market it had lost, and considered privatization.
By March 1993 wages had dropped and productivity rose as Slovenia worked to stay competitive without cheap Serbian raw materials.
Privatization and market reform had begun.
In February 1994 Slovenia made overtures to Belgrade regarding normalization of relations in an effort to adapt its policy to that of the European Union, which it wanted to join.
Serbia expressed interest but remained resentful, saying first Slovenia needed to end its anti-Serbian campaign.
