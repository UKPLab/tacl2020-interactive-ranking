From February 1988 until October 1989 there was debate in the U.S. Senate and House over whether to include illegal aliens in the 1990 census count that would be used for reapportionment of Congressional seats.
States with large numbers of illegal aliens tended to favor inclusion while those with few favored exclusion.
Twice the Senate approved amendments to major bills that would exclude the illegal aliens and twice the House refused to go along with the Senate vote.
The matter was finally referred to House-Senate Conference where on October 19, 1989 the negotiators agreed to include illegal aliens in the count.
