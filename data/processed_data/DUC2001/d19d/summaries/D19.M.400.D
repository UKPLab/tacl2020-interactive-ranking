Forty members of the House of Representatives along with the Federation for American Immigration Reform will take part in a lawsuit that will be filed in the U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh.
The groups will sue the Census Bureau in an effort to force the agency to delete illegal aliens from the 1990 count.
Traditionally, the Census Bureau counts everyone living in the country.
The groups, which have filed suit to ignore the illegal aliens, believe that large concentrations of them could result in some states gaining seats in the House of Representatives at the expense of other states.
Opposing groups want the final census totals to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked.
These include Blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
There is a 435-seat limit in Congress.
Therefore, when one state gains a house member another must loose one.
The Constitution was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment of House seats will be based on "the whole number of persons in each state."
The amendment does not mention citizenship in connection with apportionment.
Lawmaker clashed while debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens.
The Census Bureau contends that the effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and complicate the count and in effect invalidate it.
Identifying illegal aliens for the count may be a difficult thing to do.
Generally speaking a person who is in the country illegally does not want to be spotted by the government.
And then there is the question of who should be counted as a person and who, if anybody should not.
Public officials in California condemned a Senate vote to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census.
The general feeling is that the Senate's action will shortchange California in Congress.
California stands to loose millions of dollars in federal aid for the poor.
In the past, about $80 million has been paid out annually for emergency medical services for California's illegal aliens.
"Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens" observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis. on the other hand said, "It is wrong to apportion Congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced."
The Senate, with its' vote to exclude illegal aliens from the census count has opened the door for the Supreme Court to make the final decision.
