Clarence Thomas, a black conservative republican, was confirmed as a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on 16 October 1991.
He replaced Thurgood Marshall who retired.
Prior to confirmation, journalists wondered how much influence Thomas' wife, Virginia, might have on his Supreme Court decisions.
Thomas was born into poverty in Pinpoint, Georgia, in 1948.
His father deserted the family and his mother was forced to send her son to the grandparents.
His grandfather was a taskmaster who taught him hard work and self-reliance.
His grandparents scraped together enough money to send him to a local catholic school.
Later, he entered a seminary but left disillusioned when he discovered prejudice there.
Clarence Thomas worked his way through Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, earning a Bachelor's degree in 1971.
He became a black activist.
He went on to Yale Law School, earning a degree in law in 1974.
It was during law school that he became more conservative in his political views.
He became a critic of affirmative action and racial preferences for minority groups.
John Danforth, who later became a senator for Missouri, selected Thomas as an assistant attorney general shortly after Thomas' graduation from Yale in 1974.
In 1982 Thomas was appointed Chairman, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
In 1990, President Bush selected Clarence Thomas to the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Complaints from liberals and senior citizens were ignored during the confirmation hearings.
Thomas is a bootstrap conservative and a believer in personal strength and individualism over government activism.
Civil rights groups opposed Thomas, saying that he was insensitive to the concerns of minorities and the elderly.
In place of quotas and affirmative action, Thomas believed that one should take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the U.S. Peggy Noonan of the Wall Street Journal believed that Thomas "made it" because he was loved by his mother, grandparents and the nuns who taught him.
Thomas, says Noonan, did not make it on his own but has been helped all his life by affirmative action.
On 16 October 1991, when confirmation to the Supreme Court came for Thomas, it brought joy and prayer to his mother and the townspeople of Pinpoint, Georgia.
When asked about the sexual harassment charge brought against her son by Anita Hill in 1981- 83, his mother replied with a prayer and a comment that "someone put her up to it."
