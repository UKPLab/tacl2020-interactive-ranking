The disease that affects cows, eating holes in their brains and in its later stages causing them to act crazily is known as "mad cow disease".
Its more formal name is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE.
Scrapie is a similar disease that affects sheep, it has been around since the 1700s.
The cow disease was first diagnosed in 1986.
It proliferated, and despite the 1988 ban on a processed cattle feed that included the remains of diseased sheep, the incidence of BSE continued apace.
By 1994 about 122,000 "mad" cows had been destroyed in Britain.
The government paid farmers 100% of market value for each cow destroyed.
The 3.7 billion-dollar British beef industry was threatened by import bans imposed by other countries against British beef.
Strains of BSE were seen in other animal species.
The British public was highly concerned of its spread to humans.
A rare human disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob or CJD, has symptoms similar to BSE.
The 1993 deaths of two British dairy farmers who had CJD caused alarm.
No firm link between CJD and BSE has been proven, bur researchers in America, Czechoslovakia and Germany are studying the connection, if any, between the diseases.
