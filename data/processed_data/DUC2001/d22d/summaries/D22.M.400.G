Extensive wildfires within the United States throughout 1988 and 1989 kept firefighters highly active.
Wildfires over the July 4, 1988 weekend were combated mostly in national parks, forests, wilderness areas, and wildlands in Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, California, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.
The fires were started primarily by lightning, fireworks, and vehicle exhaust pipes.
Firefighters generally followed Forestry Service policy to allow wilderness fires to burn unless they threatened rails or structures.
In Missouri, forest officials had studied arson as a cause of forest fires there.
Accordingly, people burned the woods to allow grass to grow for open grazing, and subsistence farmers claimed fire helped control ticks, snakes, and disease.
By September of 1988, several forest fires in the Western states were still underway; namely in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming, but were under control or not threatening.
Seven weeks after some of the worst fires ever recorded in Yellowstone Park, the Park's environmental researchers were monitoring what they claimed were amazing steps the forest had taken to renew itself.
They hoped the evidence would testify to the value of the "natural burn" policy.
Critics have preferred controlled burning, selective logging, and reforestation.
A panel that reported to the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior in 1988 recommended a moratorium in the "let it burn" policy until the Forest Service and National Park Service could refine management plans.
The panel agreed that there were benefits to letting wilderness areas burn, but they felt that in some cases the social and economic effects might be unacceptable.
By mid-1989, some 31,000 brush and timber fires had been reported in Utah, California, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Washington, Alaska, and Georgia.
1,111,000 acres reportedly had burned so far compared to 765,000 acres last season.
Firefighters contended with wind and high temperatures at first, but rain and higher humidity eventually helped.
In California, brush fires apparently started by people near a roadside store, were finally contained in the Cleveland National Forest near Lake Elsinore.
An Antelope Valley fire was contained but six structures were burned as more than 300 firefighters battled the blaze for three days.
Southwest of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a creek contaminated by ash from a lightning-caused Divide fire forced the rescue of hundreds of endangered fish.
Fires were also contained in Arizona, Nebraska, Wyoming, and in three locations in Colorado, as well as along the California coastline near Big Sur.
