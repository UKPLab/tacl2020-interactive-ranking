Throughout 1988 and into 1989, wildfires kept firefighters active across the United States.
The fires were extensive in national parks, forests, wilderness areas and wildlands in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia.
Wildfires over the July 4, 1988 weekend were primarily started by lightning, fireworks, and vehicle exhaust pipes.
Firefighters generally followed the Forest Service's "natural burn" policy.
Researchers at Yellowstone Park, which earlier had some of its worst fires ever recorded, had gathered evidence of forest renewal as support to their policy.
However, a panel had recommended to the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior in 1988 that a moratorium should be declared on that policy until the Forest Service and National Park Service could refine management plans.
By mid-1989, some 31,000 brush and timber fires had been reported in nine Western states and Georgia.
1,111,000 acres had burned up to that time compared to 765,000 acres the previous season.
Firefighters initially contended with wind and high temperature but rain and higher humidity eventually helped.
Major fires were contained in Arizona, Nebraska, Wyoming, three locations in Colorado, and also in California's Lake Elsimore area and Big Sur coastline.
